## Benchmark Results

### Individual Run Times
| Run | Async Time | Sync Time |
|-----|------------|-----------|
| 1   | 5.02s     | 0.31s     |
| 2   | 0.78s     | 0.09s     |
| 3   | 0.73s     | 0.09s     |

### Summary Statistics
- **Average Async Time:** 2.18s
- **Average Sync Time:** 0.16s
- **Speedup Factor:** 0.08x (sync faster than async)

### Per-Request Performance
- **Async:** 0.09s per request
- **Sync:** 0.01s per request

## Analysis

### Unexpected Results
1. **Sync Outperformed Async:**
   - The synchronous implementation was significantly faster than the async version
   - This is contrary to our previous benchmark results with the FMP API

### Potential Reasons
1. **Yahoo Finance API Behavior:**
   - The API might be optimized for single-threaded access
   - Rate limiting appears to be more aggressive with concurrent requests
   - Evidence: "Too Many Requests" error in first async run

2. **Connection Pooling:**
   - Sync implementation benefits from yfinance's internal connection reuse
   - Async implementation might be creating too many concurrent connections

3. **First Run Anomaly:**
   - First async run (5.02s) was significantly slower due to rate limiting
   - Subsequent runs show more consistent performance but still slower than sync

### Recommendations

1. **Implementation Changes:**
   - Consider using the sync implementation for price data
   - If async is required, implement more aggressive rate limiting
   - Add exponential backoff for rate limit errors

2. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls
   - Add request queuing to prevent rate limit errors
   - Consider batch endpoints if available from Yahoo Finance

3. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Evaluate other data providers with better concurrent access support
   - Consider maintaining a local price database with periodic updates
   - Implement request batching at a higher level

## Conclusions
Unlike our FMP API results, the Yahoo Finance API performs better with synchronous requests. This suggests that different APIs require different optimization strategies, and the async-first approach isn't always the best choice. For the price service, we should either:

1. Use the synchronous implementation
2. Implement more sophisticated request handling in the async version
3. Consider alternative data sources that better support concurrent access
