Welcome to the Accenture's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instruction will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Angie Park. Please go ahead.\nAngie Park: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2021. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Today, we are very pleased to announce strong financial results for our first quarter. I will begin by thanking our 514,000 people for their hard work and dedication to delivering value for our clients, which is what these results represent. Last quarter, I shared that as we began our fiscal year 2021, we were turning a page, no longer navigating a crisis, but facing a new reality with a laser focus on delivering value to our clients at this time of great need and on returning to pre-COVID growth rates by the second-half of our fiscal year. I also shared how we began fiscal year 2021 stronger than pre-crisis. Our results in Q1 made clear how we have strengthened our market position, as well as our ability to pivot our business with agility. Not only have we delivered a strong quarter, but we took exciting new actions to continue to strengthen our market position for FY 2021 and the future. Let's start with our financial results. We delivered revenue growth of 2% in local currency, well ahead of our guidance with broad-based improvement across the globe. We continue to extend our leadership position with our growth estimated over the trailing four quarters to be more than four times the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. We delivered exceptionally strong new bookings of $12.9 billion, a 25% increase over Q1 last year, including 16 clients with over $100 million in bookings. We continued to invest substantially in our business, including closing 10 acquisitions this quarter in strategic areas, such as Cloud, Intelligent Operations and Industry X. And as KC will walk through, we delivered strong profitability and returned substantial cash to shareholders. Now, let me highlight the actions we've taken in Q1 to better serve our clients, attract the best talent and extend our leadership as a responsible business and trusted partner. We created Accenture Cloud First with the planned $3 billion three-year investment to help clients in what has become a once in a digital era replatforming of global business in the cloud. We launched our new purpose, our growth strategy to deliver 360-degree value to our clients and our largest and most significant new brand campaign in a decade. In our annual cycle in December, we promoted 605 Managing Directors with a record 39% women, and I appointed 663 Senior Managing Directors, including a record 29% women. I'm excited to announce today that we met our previous goal of 25% women Managing Directors globally by the end of 2020, and have raised the bar again, setting a new goal of 30% by the end of 2025. With 45% women overall, we are on track to meet our goal of 50-50 gender equality by 2025. We set external goals in the U.S., UK and South Africa to achieve greater race and ethnicity representation overall, and among Managing Directors in these countries by 2025. We remain the only major professional services company in our industry around the world, public or private to set these types of external goals and to have our level of transparency. We believe our diversity and commitment to inclusion and equality have been and will continue to be critical to our success and a differentiator into attracting the best talent. And building on our long-standing and well-recognized commitment to the environment, we announced industry-leading goals for 2025 to achieve net zero emissions, move to zero waste and plan for water risk. As you can see, we have been busy moving forward in our new reality. KC, over to you.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and represent a positive first step to achieving our full-year objectives. The focused execution of our strategy continues to extend our leadership position in the marketplace, as we deliver significant value to our clients and our shareholders in an uncertain and volatile environment. So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenues grew 2% in local currency and continue to include a reduction of approximately 2 percentage points from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Q1 revenues were more than $200 million above our guided range, driven by broad-based over-delivery across markets, services and industries. We also continue to extend our leadership positions with growth significantly above the market. The diversity of our business continues to serve us well, and the industry trends remain consistent with the last few quarters. Approximately 50% of our revenues came from seven industries that were less impacted by the pandemic, and in aggregate continue to grow high single digits, with continued double-digit growth in public service, software platforms and life sciences. At the same time, we saw continued pressure but at a more moderate level from clients in highly impacted industries, which include: travel, energy, high-tech, including aerospace and defence, retail and industrial. While performance varied, this group represents over 20% of our revenues and declined low double digits. Our operating margin was 16.1% for the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. We delivered expansion while making significant investments in our business and our people to extend our market leadership. We continue to benefit from lower spend on travel and events. And we delivered very strong EPS of $2.17, up 8% over fiscal 2020, after adjusting both years for gains on an investment. And finally, we delivered significant free cash flow of $1.5 billion and returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested approximately $500 million in acquisitions and we expect to invest at least $1.7 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. With those high level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $12.9 billion for the quarter, reflecting an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $6.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $6.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. We were very pleased with our bookings this quarter, which grew 25%, driven by both technology services and operations. We were also pleased with the strength of our bookings in strategy and consulting, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Looking forward, we continue to feel very good about our pipeline. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $11.8 billion, a 4% increase in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency, including a reduction of approximately 2% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.3 billion, a decline of 1% in U.S. dollars and a decline of 2% in local currency, including a reduction of approximately 3% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Outsourcing revenues were $5.4 billion, up 9% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, operations grew double digits, technology services grew mid-single digits, and strategy and consulting services declined low double digit. Turning to our geographic markets. The industry dynamics that I mentioned earlier continue to play out in a similar manner across all three markets. In North America, revenue growth was 4% in local currency. In Europe, revenue declined 1% in local currency. We saw mid-single digit growth in Italy, with UK improving to flat. In growth markets, we delivered 3% revenue growth in local currency, led by high single digit growth in both Japan and Australia. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.1%, compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.4%, compared with 10.5% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.6%, compared to 6.1% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.9 billion for the first quarter, reflecting a 16.1% operating margin, up 50 basis points compared with Q1 last year. As a reminder, last year in fiscal '20, we’ve recognized an investment gain which impacted our tax rates and increased EPS by $0.08 in the quarter. This year in Q1, we again recognized investment gain which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.15. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% for the first quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.17, compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.01 for the first quarter of last year. Days service outstanding work 38 days compared to 35 days last quarter and 43 days in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6 billion. Net of property and equipment additions of $93 million. Our cash balance at November 30th was $8.6 billion, compared with $8.4 billion in August 31st. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we’ve repurchased or redeemed 3.3 million shares for $769 million at an average price of $229.98 per share. At November 30th, we had approximately 5.8 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $558 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share to be paid on February 12th, a 10% increase over the last year. So, in summary, we were very pleased with our Q1 results, and we're off to a good start in fiscal '21. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. Let me start with the environment. We saw in Q1 a broad base increase in demand that is faster than we anticipated 90 days ago. This means that as our clients have the confidence and ability to spend, they are turning to Accenture. But the uncertainty and volatility of the biggest health, economic and social crisis in our lifetimes remains, particularly as the world continues to face a deepening health impact pre-widespread vaccination. From an overall demand perspective, the trends that we discussed last quarter are continuing. Companies need to accelerate their digital transformation across their enterprises and move to the cloud, address cost pressures, build resilience and security, adjust their operations and customer engagement to a remote everything environment and changing expectations and find new sources of growth. What is becoming even more clear however, is that we are in an era of compressed transformation, in which the winners by industry will be those who are earliest to replatform their businesses in the cloud, and have the digital core and new ways of working that allows them to continuously improve their operations and find new sources of growth, which for most leading companies is requiring them to simultaneously transform multiple parts of their enterprises and their talent. For the pre-COVID digital leaders, they are racing to widen the gap, and for the digital laggards, they are racing to leapfrog. We are uniquely positioned to help the leaders and the laggards because of the depth and breadth of our capabilities. We bring the trust, experience, speed and scale that are essential to achieve compressed transformation. Now let's bring some of these demand trends to life through the lens of our Q1, and look at our own broad-based improvement. First, replatforming to the cloud. In fiscal year '20, our cloud revenue was approximately $12 billion with low double digit growth, which accelerated in Q1 with significantly higher double digit growth, driven by Accenture Cloud First. In fact, across low to highly impacted industries, and all geographic markets, we saw strong double digit growth, the race to replatform to the cloud and create new business value is clear across all our services. Our clients need our deep technical and engineering skills, and our unmatched set of relationships with the world's leading technology ecosystem companies, which are critical partners to us and to our clients. We were pleased that in Q1 industry analysts recognized us as the leading systems integrator for each of AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform, as well as the leading multi cloud managed services provider. Fundamental to accelerating our clients’ replatforming in the cloud, however, are our leading strategy and consulting capabilities, which give us the industry and functional insights to move rapidly and achieve early business value. For example, we are working with Takeda, a global values-based R&D-driven biopharmaceutical leader to modernize their technology platforms, including moving 80% of applications to the cloud, accelerate data services and establish an internal engine for innovation, while equipping employees with new skills and ways of working and reducing their carbon footprint. The business impact is illustrated by the plans for Takeda's plasma derived therapies business unit, which is harnessing the power of the cloud and these data services to create state-of-the-art digitally connected donation centers and modernize the donor experience, optimizing the plasma collection process, and contributing to the goal of increasing plasma collection and manufacturing by at least 65% by 2024. We are working with the Norwegian Health Net [ph] to create a health analytics platform, which is using the power of the cloud to analyze and interpret data, and ultimately improve patient outcomes, by reducing research turnaround times and access to data from months to a matter of minutes or days. And we are working with Generali, a major player in the global insurance industry to help replatform approximately 70% of its IT footprint to the cloud, to improve service quality, innovate and build a set of new cloud ready core insurance applications for emerging markets, while achieving a sustainable reduction in its total cost of ownership, and helping to upscale its workforce. In Intelligent Platform Services, which returned to low single digit growth this quarter, we saw building momentum fueled by our clients rotating to Software-as-a-Service, as well as new digital platforms. In a quick trip around the world, we see this compressed transformation playing out from the rapid transformation of the finance functions of Nickel Bank, a subsidiary of BNP Paribas, and a fast growing Neo-bank in France, with the implementation of leading software-as-a-service and ERP solutions, to the cloud based marketing transformation of a global bank with a large U.S. footprint with a SaaS implementation across its worldwide private banking network, to one of the largest implementations in the chemicals industry of a modern digital ERP system, hosted on the cloud for Indorama Ventures, a world class chemicals company with global operations headquartered in Asia, that will provide a single source of information globally, and cloud-based solutions to enhance its operations, employee development capabilities, and customer and supplier experiences. So that's the cloud. Now let's turn to digitizing operations across the Enterprise. In operations, which returned to double digit growth this quarter, we are helping our clients transform by digitizing their operations with our SynOps platform, increasing agility and reducing cost. Operations as-a-service that enables us to continue diversify our value to clients by expanding across functions and industries, we have an unmatched global footprint ability to invest an innovation engine powered by the broader Accenture. We were excited to welcome to the Accenture family this quarter N3, an Atlanta-based B2B sales firm, with more than 2,000 employees that combined specialized talent in AI and machine learning to enable smarter, more efficient sales interactions and drive sales growth in virtual environments. The power of Accenture's breadth and depth comes together at Halliburton, a leading provider of products and services to the energy industry, and a leader in driving true enterprise wide transformation enabled by digital and technology. Last quarter, we shared how we are helping Halliburton move to cloud-based digital platforms. This quarter, we announced that we are teaming with Halliburton to accelerate its digital supply chain transformation, and support digitization within Halliburton's manufacturing functions to improve service levels and business outcomes. We will leverage SynOps which we already use as part of Halliburton's digital transformation of its finance and accounting function, and our strategy and consulting expertise. In Industry X, we are digitizing manufacturing and operations and creating intelligent products and platforms. In fiscal year '20, Industry X was approximately $3 billion and grew low double digits, which is continued in Q1. We see COVID deepening the need to transform manufacturing in a contactless world with disrupted supply chains and greater cost pressures. One of our latest wins with that CNH Industrial, the manufacturer of capital goods across the agriculture, construction equipment and commercial vehicle sectors, where we are improving the global operating model to develop smart connected products and services that will grow revenue, while building a digitally enabled workforce and enhancing security and sustainability. Finally, let's look at the trends around new ways of engaging customers, patients, citizens and employees. In interactive, which is all about the business of experience, the crisis had a significant impact due to severe disruptions in industries like travel and retail, and due to our clients being focused on shoring up their experience of their businesses, rather than the next generation of experiences. This quarter we saw building momentum with a return to low single digit growth from a low single digit decline in H2 of FY'20 as clients focus on creating new experiences in the new environment. For example, Accenture Federal Services is working with the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to reimagine retirement services for the digital age and improve the customer experience for a retirement savings plan serving 6.1 million civilian employees and members of the armed services with over $644 billion in assets. I want to take a moment to talk about another bold move we made this quarter. In October, we simultaneously launched a new purpose, our growth strategy to deliver 360-degree value to our clients, and a new brand campaign created by our own Droga5 team that joined our family in 2019. Our new purpose is to, deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. Our purpose is what we are uniquely able to do and our growth strategy is our action plan to bring this purpose to life. Our strategy to deliver 360-degree value to our clients is a direct response to the rising demand we see for talent transformation, and help achieving responsible business goals. We define 360-degree value as delivering the financial business case experiences and unique value a client maybe seeking, and striving where possible to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill their employees and achieve their sustainability goals. At the heart of this strategy is embedding responsible business by design into our work for clients in addition to our own operations. Our new brand, Let There Be Change, captures our purpose and the depth and breadth of Accenture's expertise. Together, our purpose, strategy and brand better reflect Accenture's unique role in helping companies reimagine and rebuild differently for the benefit of all. Over to you KC, for a look ahead.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Before I get into our business outlook, as I did last quarter, I would like to remind you that given the coronavirus pandemic, there are a number of factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and magnitude of the impact, the pace of the recovery, as well as those described in our most recent quarterly filings. Now, with that said, let me turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $11.55 billion to $11.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '20, and reflects an estimated 1% to 4% in local currency and includes a reduction of approximately 2 percentage points from a decline in revenue from reimbursable travel costs. The entire range for Q2 reflects the continued build back of our business over Q1. For the full fiscal year '21, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 3% compared to fiscal '20. For the full fiscal '21, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 4% to 6% growth in local currency over fiscal '20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel, based on a 2% reduction in the first-half of the year and no material impact in the second-half of the year. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '21 to be 14.8% to 15.0%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '20 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '20. For earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '21 to be in the range of $8.17 to $8.40. We now expect adjusted full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.02 to $8.25 or 8% to 11% growth over adjusted fiscal '20 results. For the full fiscal '21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $6.65 billion to $7.15 billion. Property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $5.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Angie?\nAngie Park: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Good morning, guys. Great to hear all of you and happy holidays. I would just ask my two right up-front. Looking at the utilization number of 93% in the quarter, I peeked back and that is the highest number you've reported in more than 10 years. So two questions, one more strategic and one more numbers related on that. I guess, first, can utilization be structurally higher now with the shift to remote work and so we should expect these kinds of levels going forward? Or are you kind of getting to the point that you're labor constrained and you're going to be ramping hiring and that number will come down a bit? That's the more, I guess, strategic question. And then maybe for KC, was higher utilization the primary driver of the 100 basis point increase in gross margins? Or is that also being affected by the reduction in travel costs? Thank you.\nKC McClure: Okay. Hi, Lisa. Thanks for your question. Happy holidays. So maybe I'll start with your second question first. Just on gross margin. So we did have expansion in gross margin and there were a few drivers to that. The first is contract profitability was up this quarter. And in contract profitability, we did benefit from lower travel, so that does help our contract profitability overall. So that is the first thing, I would say, benefited our gross margin. And you do see that the fact that we have higher utilization also does help our gross margin as well. So both of those points were included in drivers of our gross margin. And when you look at utilization, we did have a very high productivity this quarter. It did click up in parts and that was pretty broad-based and that was also driven by our over-delivery of Q1 revenue. We did continue to recruit throughout the summer, and obviously into this quarter, you can see that our headcount is up sequentially. And so we don't see any issues meeting demand and attracting talent. And to your point on, is there a structural change from working remotely, the answer is really no. We were just able to get more productivity out of all of our groups this quarter. And looking forward, we do think that's going to kind of ease back into kind of a more normal range, which still is very high productivity, but not continuing at these levels.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Good results here. I want to just ask about the outlook here and what's changed in the last 90 days. I know you received – looking at revenue while you're up $200 million over your guidance, you overcame low-double-digit declines in strategy and in consulting. From a macro standpoint, we got what vaccines have been approved and cases are up, but your bookings are strong again. So I'm just trying to think you seem really well set up for the second-half to be quite strong, even if strategy and consulting comes back slowly. So do you feel more confident in the outlook for strategy and consulting? Or is the composition of work just changing versus what you thought maybe 90 days ago? Any thoughts on that?\nKC McClure: Yes. So let me just talk a little bit about what drove our overperformance in Q1, and how that impacts our view of Q2 and H2, Tien-Tsin. So, when you look at Q1, we were obviously very pleased with our performance, and we have rather significant over-delivery against our expectations. And that was really driven by broad-based over-delivery, in all three of our markets, in all of our industry groups and all of our services all did a bit better. And as I mentioned in our script, when you take a look at the industries and the higher impacted industries, which represent over 20% of our revenues, they did improve from Q4 of a decline of mid-teens to low double digits. And as Julie talked quite a bit about the fact that that was really driven broad-based by our strong demand in cloud. And so that is an area that performed better than we expected. But if you also look at the lower impacted industries, which are 50% of our revenue, they continue to grow high single digits like Q4, but they actually did improve also within that sense. And so let me maybe connect this a little bit to how we did our sales this quarter. So we had a very strong start to the year, as you could see in our sales of $12.9 billion, which is about $2.5 billion more than what we've done in the last two quarter ones, last two fiscal years. And when you peel that back, Tien-Tsin, you can see that it was really driven by all categories of our sales side, so the large, which Julie highlighted that we have 16 clients over $100 million in sales, but all the way through and significantly driven by an improvement in our smaller deals, which came in better than we expected. And that can help us with revenue yield in the current quarter. So when I take a look at that, that's what happened with Q1. And then when you look at that compared to 90 days ago, obviously, that's better. And when you look at -- then what for Q2, we obviously have a better outlook for Q2 than we did 90 days ago with our 1% to 4% growth range. Really important to note that all of points in that range are an improvement over Q1. So we continue to build back our business from the lows of H2. And we would be really pleased with anywhere that we land in that range. Now, when you look at the second-half of the year, we haven't changed our views on the second-half of the year from 90 days ago. And just to be very specific, we still see that we would have high single-digit to low double-digit growth in the back-half of the year. And just as a reminder, the four factors that we talked about last quarter that we're going to drive that remain the same. And just very briefly, they are first, that we continue to expect an improvement in the macroeconomic environment. We don't see another -- we're not anticipating another macroeconomic shock that's built into our guidance. We expect to see more of a benefit from the significant transformational deals that we sold last year. And at the same time, to your question, we do expect strategy and consulting to reconnect with growth. And our performance in Q1 and our outlook for Q2 do encourage us even more on that statement this quarter. And the fourth thing is that we have the benefit of an easier compare that obviously remains the same. And we are also still going to anniversary the reimbursable revenue headwind, that's 2% in the first-half of the year and that won't be a headwind in the back-half of the year. So, of course, we're still meeting with our clients, you can see that by the fact that we were able to book $27 billion in the last two quarters. But we are not planning on having significant increases in revenue related to travel in the back-half of the year. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we see the business compared to what is stay the same now from 90 days ago, which is our outlook in H2. But obviously, we're very pleased with the improvements and performance in Q1 and outlook for Q2 than we had 90 days ago.\nJulie Sweet: And, Tien-Tsin, let me just kind of give you a little more color from the clients’ perspective, because -- and this is what I talked a little bit about in my script, right?. If you just sort of remember, pre-COVID, we said we were in the early innings of transformation with the beginning of the decade, it’d be enterprise-wide, right? COVID hits, technology becomes the lifeline. And you really see companies understanding kind of the two truths of our world, right? There is - every business is now a technology business and exponential technology change is going to continue, right? And now it's about the speed. And this is why we're seeing what I'm calling compressed transformation, where you continue to see companies say we are going to take on this transformation more broadly. So look at the example of Takeda. They're both moving to the cloud, improving their data and making sure that they're getting near-term business value. You take a Halliburton, cloud, finance, supply chain. So there's this speed of change and we see that in the confidence. We're nine months in now. The first part of the crisis, people were getting their footing, getting back up and running. And it's interesting, we did some research in July across 10 markets and nearly 80% of the executives that we surveyed said that they were planning on investing in digital transformation. And that was up from 50% in May. And we're continuing just to see this recognition of the need to get there faster. And then what's important to understand is that, all of this is happening, though, in the context of the cost pressures, the changing expectations. And this is where a decade and in some cases multiple decades of investment from Accenture has put us in a very unique position, because no other company in our industry can simultaneously do operations and that help a company reduce their supply chain in their finance function and reduce costs and digitize. At the same time, we're helping them migrate to the cloud and give them that view, which because all of this has interdependencies. You want to get end-to-end process change. And we have literally been building these capabilities for years and years. And this is where the scale and the breadth matter.\nTien-Tsin Huang: It sounds very clear. I appreciate for the complete answer, guys, here, and it seems like the outlook is set up pretty well here. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Neill from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatthew O'Neill: Yes, thank you so much for taking my question. I was hoping we could drill down a little bit deeper into Accenture Cloud First, I think it's just on 90 days since the formal announcement. Curious, understanding a lot of sort of anecdotes in the prepared remarks around Takeda, Halliburton, et cetera. But where you're seeing the most immediate need to deploy the $3 billion that you identified for an investment, earliest and first? And sort of mirroring that where the greatest demand is coming from the client side, understanding, there's kind of a broad-based, I think COVID-driven catalyst to potentially get off the fence and move one's business to become fully digital cloud, et cetera, et cetera?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. So, Matthew, thanks for the question. So maybe just take, let's just first start why our companies having to accelerate faster to the cloud. And there's a few clear reasons. So first of all, there's a cost pressure, because when they move to the cloud, there's immediate savings just in the migration and there's obviously to get that kind of savings. Second, the cloud is really important for resilience and security. And in this current environment in particular, you can see why that matters. The crisis really exposed the vulnerabilities of a lot of the on premise IT estates. And then that has been compounded, of course, by the expansion of the threat surface through more remote working. And so the resilience and security of the cloud is also an immediate driver as to the need to do that. What I would say is probably most important and really the rapid acceleration is the need for the power of the cloud to enable the data driven transformations. And so you saw that in the example that we gave, with Takeda, where they're changing the customer experience, which requires near real time access to data in order to personalize and to be able to actually do that. And what I think is very unique, I know is very unique about Accenture is that this is where our strategy and consulting capabilities are so important, because the reason to go to the cloud is not simply cost and resilience and security, it's about the business value. And here's how we're helping clients get early business value. And you have to deeply understand the industry, the patients, the customer, and also what data is valuable among all of the data and which workloads go first. And so, it really is driven by all of these things at once, which is why our capabilities around changed management, around talent transformation and leadership are important, because, by the way, everybody wants to go higher at cloud talent in this thing. And so, it's not going to be enough available to our ability to reskill, which you saw in each of these examples that we gave in the script like Generali and Takeda is also a critical. So that's sort of the big picture. Now, when you think about where we're going to do investment, we talked about we did 10 acquisitions this quarter, four of them were in cloud. They were in each of our three markets and they were about building scale for the most part in more markets. And so, as we think about the acquisition strategy which will be a big component of the $3 billion, it's about building scale and markets around the world as well as acquiring niche capabilities. The second big area of that $3 billion investment though, is creating more and more of the assets that will allow our clients to move quickly. Everything from the myNav asset that we talked about, that does a fast diagnostic with benchmarks to help clients figure out what kind of a strategy to have and how to get value to the migrating navigate advisor that helps you figure out the reduction in carbon, to the industry blueprints that we're creating, and the solutions that are repeatable like in digital manufacturing on the cloud. So this will be an important part of our continued investment. And again, it really comes right back to -- no other company has both these deep engineering and infrastructure skills, the deep relationships. And then the strategy and consulting capabilities to actually move industries to the cloud to create business value solutions. And you don't build that overnight. We have been building our strategy and consulting business for decades. We have been an early adopter for cloud for decades. And let's not forget, we're our own best credential when it comes to all of these capabilities.\nMatthew O'Neill: That's really helpful and interesting. I guess, as a quick follow-up, I was just curious, you mentioned in the script Droga5 acquisition and more broadly Accenture Interactive. And wondering if there's significant sort of cross sell and upsell opportunity as you integrate more assets like Droga5 and present a more comprehensive suite to both the existing and new clients for things that they might not have maybe originally known or thought of Accenture for first and foremost. Is that a part of the equation here?\nJulie Sweet: Absolutely. And when you think about Accenture Interactive, like we are doing amazing work like our own brand and purpose work for ourselves via again our best credential. But what these capabilities bring is we're actually embedding them in all of our services. Our clients come to us for outcomes and experience is a really important part of it. Again, when you think about the work we are doing with Prudential that we talked about last quarter, that was fundamentally a different way of engaging with the customer. Takeda, a different way of engaging with the donor, the researchers in the Norway example about how they're going to engage. We are embedding this experience, and how to do that in all of our work, and so that's why I often talk about, I know you all certainly look at our services, separately our four services, our clients look at our outcomes. And what differentiates us is our ability to embed the business of experience across Accenture, as well as going to market of course, like a Droga5 that continues to do amazing, pure work in terms of brand for example.\nMatthew O'Neill: Thanks so much. Really helpful. Thinking about that in the context of sort of experience and outcome. I'll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on bookings. Was there anything pulled forward in bookings relative to your prior expectation? Or do you still anticipate a building cadence for the year? And can you comment on bookings conversion pace and considering the outperformance you've had the last two quarters. I'm just curious how you're seeing the pace of these larger transformational engagements?\nKC McClure: Yes, thanks. We were really pleased with our bookings this quarter. As I mentioned, they did grow 25%, and as you just pointed out, and I mentioned as well, we did have a stronger Q1 than we had in the last two years. If you peel that back it's really because the demand, again, which was very broad-based. It was really also driven by cloud, which we've talked a lot about Industry X security. So they're also aligned to our strategic priorities. If you look at it, what drove the strength in bookings, again, broad base, when you look at it by type of work. We have particular strengths in outsourcing, that really was up quite a bit with very strong book-to-bill. But, within the 16 clients that we booked over $100 million, they were represented, what I liked about that is by outsourcing as well as consulting type work, it was a nice mix, all five of our industry groups were in there too. So again, it points to very broad-based. And if you look at the services, again, no surprise based on cloud, security and Industry X tech services, very strong. And I mentioned, I just want to highlight again, that we are pleased with our progress in strategy and consulting, they had a 1.1 book-to-build in the quarter. So, overall, we felt really pleased. And as it relates to kind of what we see ahead, we feel very good about our pipeline. And if you're taking on the question about conversion or revenue yield in bigger deals, we did see that our bookings were strong across all parts of our sales, large all the way through, but particularly to the smaller deals, and they do yield more revenue in the current quarter. So that's also true. And then as you see -- when you look really at our duration, it's not that the duration of the bookings in themselves have changed, it's really more of the services that are in the mix. So, as we have more strategy and consulting bookings coming online, they obviously tend to be of a shorter duration. So nothing's really changed in the duration of each of our individual services. It's really more of the mix of the bookings within each quarter.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And so next quarter, we expect a very nice, very strong quarter in bookings.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just over the last several years, you've had special businesses here that competitors have not that have enabled you to grow faster than the market. I'm thinking about operations and interactive specifically, as critical growth engines. From here, do you anticipate a rotation of the growth engine? So is Cloud First and Industry X, are those the new engines that you expect to drive above market? I'm just curious, how you consider those now relative to competitors that are also heavily investing in those areas. And doing so earlier today than they did around interactive before?\nKC McClure: Sure, great question. So let me just start with, we have been investing in cloud for a decade, which is a very hard to replicate. And so we start with a $12 billion business that is growing strong double digits. So we would expect to continue to take market share there. And in this environments, where you have a rapid acceleration, and you're moving mission critical workloads, we would expect to continue to differentiate, because of our decades of experience and our relationships with the world's leading technology ecosystem players. So cloud will continue to be a big trend. Think about Industry X, and we've talked about this now for some time, it's kind of the next Accenture Interactive. And as you know, we've been investing in Industry X for some time. The COVID, what we're seeing the early signs of is that like in other areas, Industry X is we think going to accelerate over the next couple of years, because that was still a newer part of the enterprise that was being digitized the manufacturing and operations space. But as we now need to have like, a lot of health concerns about can you do manufacturing in a more contactless way, the supply chains have been disrupted. And so we have said, for some time Industry X is going to be the next growth engine. And the early signs are is that it's likely to be accelerating as well. So we'll see how that continues to play out. And remember, Accenture Interactive is an ongoing growth engine. I mean, we have three big platforms. You have the move to the cloud, which then has the data and the business value innovation on top. So it's not just moving there, it's everything that comes. And so that is an early innings, 20% into the cloud, but it's not just about the move, it's our unique ability to create business value to access the data and you're seeing that in the examples of what we're doing. This depends on where you are on that journey. So that is an ongoing platform for waves and waves of instant growth. The second being everything we do around intelligent operations, our operations business, our ability to move to modern digital platforms like what we talked about in IPS today. So that, again, provides we're early innings in the digitization of operations. And then Accenture Interactive, the business of experience that's an ongoing business in terms of that will always have to continue to evolve. And so, we see that the impact of the COVID crisis, we're starting to move out of that and building momentum. We continue to expect that to be a growth engine. And once again, this is where you can't make up for quickly the scale that we've achieved, because we've been investing for years and creating these capabilities. And then finally, you have this area of Industry X, and not to mention security and data, which will all continue to be of growing engines for us.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Good morning, guys, and congrats on the solid results. I wanted to ask on Interactive, just trying to understand the trajectory there. What did it kind of do in the fourth quarter? Did it even turn negative growth? And then now it's at low single, so does it kind of move up from here? I know there's been a lot of questions before on Interactive, given would that business be weaker during kind of a slowdown and it looks like it's hanging in there. So just curious on the trajectory where it was last quarter and kind of what you expect it to do throughout the year?\nKC McClure: Yes, so in each two so kind of a whole six months, it was a low single digit decline, and now we're in a low positive growth rate. And it's building momentum. So, for example, we're helping a big European bank with their digital sales, new things. So everyone's now starting to kind of reconnect with new experiences.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And then just on the other strategic priority on security, low double digit growth, is that about the right growth rate for that, too? Or does that also accelerate as we get into the back-half when we see the pickup in the growth rates?\nKC McClure: Look, I think on security, we're super pleased with that about double digit growth. So, whether it's going to be low or strong, it'll probably ebb and flow. But the consistency of that double digit growth in security has been impressive to-date, and we continue to see that to be the trajectory. Thanks.\nAngie Park: Great. Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Okay, that question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask, you mentioned that you have some targets for M&A this year. From a spend perspective, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a valuation perspective and how we should expect those to contribute to growth in the coming fiscal year or during the current fiscal year and beyond? And what kind of areas you're targeting more specifically?\nKC McClure: Yes, thanks. So in terms of our D&A, we expect to spend at least $1.7 billion and there's no change to what we started out at the beginning of the year, the 2% expectation of additional revenue growth for this year. And it's aligned to really a lot of our all of our strategic priorities that we went through.\nJames Faucette: And then thinking about that and I realized look that's consistent with what you've said before. But I'm just wondering how we should project that then into the future? Is this kind of the right level of acquisitions for Accenture? Or should we expect that to grow? Or do you think we're in a peak period? Just trying to think about that part of capital allocation. Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yes, sure. So we've always aimed around 20%, 25% of our operating cash flow in our capital allocation program to be for D&A. But we've always had the ability and we continue to have the ability to do more should any opportunity arise. So there's really no change to how we view D&A of our capital allocation. Thanks.\nJames Faucette: Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Great. So thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. We're very pleased with our strong start in fiscal '21. Thank you again to our incredible people across the globe. And thank you to our shareholders for your continued trust. Best wishes to all for a safe, healthy and joyful holiday season.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Angie and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, we are proud to announce outstanding financial results for the second quarter of fiscal ‘21 and our return to pre-COVID level financial results a quarter earlier than we expected and with a tough compare. Let’s first go back 12 months ago, on March 19, only 8 days after the pandemic was declared, when we were all together to announce our outstanding fiscal year ‘20 Q2 financial results. Results you may not remember, because at the time, we were all focused on the go-forward potential impact of the pandemic. In Q2 of fiscal year ‘20, we had 8% revenue growth in local currency, our then highest bookings ever of $14.2 billion and strong underlying profitability and free cash flow. We also announced that 18 clients that quarter had bookings over $100 million. With this backdrop of fiscal year ‘20 Q2, the significance of this Q2’s results in fiscal year ‘21 becomes even more clear. We have delivered 5.4% revenue growth in local currency, which includes a reduction of 2 percentage points from a decline in revenue from reimbursable travel costs, meaning, apples-to-apples, 5.4% is in the zone of fiscal year ‘20 Q2 revenue when you exclude the travel costs related revenue. We have delivered bookings of $16 billion, beating our previous record set in Q2 last year by $1.8 billion and we have delivered strong profitability and free cash flow. This quarter, 18 clients had bookings over $100 million and we continue to take market share faster than pre-COVID. In H1, we have accelerated our investment in B&A, with approximately $1.1 billion of capital deployed and we are increasing our programmatic B&A investment to at least $2 billion for FY ‘21 from the $1.7 billion we previously communicated. And for the last 12 months, we have remained consistent. We gave guidance every quarter which we met or beat. We deliberately invested in our people and preserved our talent to continue to serve our clients as demand came back and we continued to significantly invest in our business and our communities. And throughout, we have lived our core values, including maintaining without pause our commitment to make more progress on diversity and inclusion and sustainability. These financial results reflect these choices, the strength of our core values and the power of our laser focus on creating client value and being a trusted partner as well as our incredibly talented people, strong ecosystem relationships and the resilience of our growth strategy as well as the substantial investments we have made year in and year out, since we set out to be the leader in digital cloud and security and continuous innovation. They also reflect the operational rigor and discipline that long has been a hallmark of our success. I want to thank our people for their hard work and continued dedication to our clients and for delivering on our commitments. KC, over to you.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today’s call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations and reflects strong momentum across our business. We are particularly pleased with our record new bookings and strong revenue growth, which demonstrates our leading position in the market as a trusted partner to deliver value for our clients. Based on the strength of our second quarter results and the confidence in the second half of the fiscal year, we are increasing all elements of our full year outlook, which I will cover in more detail later in our call. Now, let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 5.4% in local currency and continue to include a reduction of approximately 2 percentage points from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Q2 revenues were nearly $140 million above our guided range driven by broad-based over-delivery across all dimensions: markets, services and industries, as our business built back even faster than anticipated. We also continued to extend our leadership position, with growth significantly above the market. We saw broad improvement in industry trends. Approximately, 50% of our revenues came from 7 industries that were less impacted by the pandemic, which in aggregate accelerated this quarter to low double-digit growth. At the same time, we saw continued improvement from clients in highly impacted industries, which collectively represents over 20% of our revenues and declined mid single-digits. Operating margin was 13.7%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points year-to-date, reflecting strong underlying profitability as we continued to invest in our business and our people, including the one-time bonus we just announced. We continued to benefit from lower spend on travel, meetings and events and we delivered very strong EPS of $2.03, up 10% over fiscal ‘20, after adjusting both years for gains on an investment. And finally, we generated significant free cash flow of $2.4 billion in the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. We continue to execute on our strategic capital allocation objective, with roughly $3.1 billion returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date. We have made investments of $1.1 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 19 transactions in the first half of the year and we expect to invest at least $2 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. With that, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $16 billion, representing a 13% growth in U.S. dollar over previous record in Q2 of last year. We had very strong overall book-to-bill of 1.3 in the quarter and 1.2 year-to-date. Consulting bookings were $8 billion, a record high with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Outsourcing bookings were also a record at $8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Similar to last quarter, our bookings were driven by both technology services and operations. We were pleased with the strength of our bookings in strategy and consulting, with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Turning now to revenues, revenues for the quarter were $12.1 billion an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 5.4% in local currency, including a reduction of approximately 2% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $6.4 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 1% local currency, including a reduction of approximately 3% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. Outsourcing revenues were $5.6 billion, up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, both operations and technology services grew double-digits. As expected, strategy and consulting services declined high single-digits and we expect strategy and consulting to return to growth in Q3. Turning to our geographic markets, the industry dynamics that I mentioned earlier continued to play out in a similar manner across all three markets. In North America, revenue growth was 7% in local currency. In Europe, revenues grew 3% in local currency, driven by mid single-digit growth in Italy and the UK. In growth markets, we delivered 6% revenue growth in local currency driven by double-digit growth in Japan. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 29.7% compared with 30.2% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.4% compared with 10.4% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expenses, was 7.6% compared to 6 point – excuse me, 6.6% compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with Q2 last year. Before I continue as a reminder, in Q2 last year, we recognized an investment gain, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.07. This quarter, we again recognized an investment gain, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.21. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.5% compared with the adjusted effective tax rate of 17.1% for the second quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.03 compared with an adjusted EPS of $1.84 in the second quarter last year. This reflects a 10% year-over-year increase. Days service outstanding were 34 days compared to 38 days last quarter and 39 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.5 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $93 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $9.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.6 million shares for $1.2 billion at an average price of $255.29 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $561 million. This represented a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share, to be paid on May 14, a 10% increase over last year. So at the halfway point of fiscal ‘21, we feel really good about our results to-date and our positioning for the remainder of the year, realizing that the pace of recovery is hard to accurately predict. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. Let me start with the environment. We continued to see compressed transformation, where companies have to simultaneously transform multiple parts of their enterprise and reskill their people in what previously would have been sequential programs. They are doing so to replatform their businesses in the cloud, address cost pressures, build resilience and security, adjust their operations and customer experiences and find new sources of growth. COVID has hit a giant fast forward button to the future and we believe the demand to innovate at unprecedented speed and scale with rapid adoption of cloud, AI and other disruptive technologies, is accelerating. For digital leaders, we see them no longer strictly competing for market share, but to build their vision of the future faster than the competition. And for digital laggards, they are determined to not simply catch up, but to leapfrog. While COVID has accelerated the demand, the reality is that the extent of transformation ahead is enormous. The move from approximately 20% to 80% in the cloud alone is a huge undertaking and it is just the start as companies will then continue to invest to grow and innovate on their new cloud foundations, which leads me to the role we are playing. In Q2, our engines of growth across Accenture have lowered to the life to meet these needs of our clients and we see strong momentum going into Q3. I will share some color and examples. We called the once in a digital era replatforming of businesses into the cloud in September 2020 when we created Accenture Cloud First to bring industry cloud and state-of-the-art change management and transformation together. We saw this quarter’s strong double-digit growth in cloud overall as well as the subset of Accenture Cloud First, which growth was even higher. Intelligent platform services, which is essential to building the digital core of our clients is back to high single-digit growth as companies resume this critical aspect of their transformation. Applied intelligence, with our data and AI solutions and security both sizable, but still in the early stages of the scale we expect long-term, both had strong double-digit growth in Q2. Operations grew double-digits as companies seek to digitize their enterprises, leveraging our deep industry and functional expertise in AI-driven SynOps platform. Interactive improved and grew high single-digits as companies continue to shift to digital channels need cost efficiencies around sales and marketing to invest in new capabilities, seek more data-driven marketing campaigns and compete for customers and employees on the experience they provide. Industry X, which is helping diversify our sources of revenue in the enterprise, grew strong double-digits, driven by the need for product and engineers to accelerate the time to market of smarter and more sustainable products and the need to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of manufacturing facilities and the ability to interconnect machines and operate remotely. These engines of growth are multi-service, bringing the best of Accenture’s strategy in consulting, interactive technology and operation services together to create value. We are distinctive, because no other competitor has our scale and breadth of services, which allows us to seamlessly serve the different dimensions of compressed transformations. We also are able to give our clients speed and cost levers through our managed services to digitize using our assets and platforms and address cost pressures. Furthermore, our distinctive capabilities in industry, innovation and investment are clear differentiators. Our strong strategy and consulting practitioners bring deep industry expertise to all functions of the enterprise and help bring together our services to deliver to our clients, often informed by cross-industry insights, such as for payments and omni-channel engagement. Our ability and commitment to consistently invest in acquisitions, R&D and our people is unmatched in our industry and our clients know that through our investment and focus on innovation, we will help future-proof them, such as our innovation in emerging technologies like the work Accenture Labs is doing, testing applications using neuromorphic computing, where circuits are modeled after systems in the human brain and nervous system to deliver new AI capabilities and our 360-degree value strategy, which seeks to bring talent upskilling, diversity and inclusion and sustainability to our work, is resonating with our clients as they seek to make progress as they transform. Two great examples of compressed transformation, strong leaders and our 360-degree value strategy are AIG and Shiseido. We are partnering with AIG, a leading global insurance organization, to help them drive their AIG 200 program, which is designed to achieve underwriting excellence, modernize their operating infrastructure, enhance user and customer experience and become a more unified company. This quarter, we acquired AIG’s shared services operations, which we will transform to serve AIG to create a modern digital shared services platform with end-to-end processes that will improve the user experience using our SynOps platform. And consistent with our 360-degree value strategy, we are investing in upskilling our new employees. We have entered into a strategic partnership with Shiseido, a leading global beauty company headquartered in Japan. Shiseido has launched a fundamental business transformation aiming to become a global leader in premium skin beauty by 2030 under its new medium to long-term strategy, Win 2023 and Beyond. We are partnering with Shiseido to accelerate digital transformation and create personalized and seamless customer experiences, design, develop and implement a cloud-based system that will help it adopt processes that enable continuous financial reporting that are forecasting accuracy and more precise inventory management. We are helping them use AI, analytics and automation to create new business value and helping their employees gain high level digital skills. We are working with Specsavers, the UK base leader in optometry, audiology and other healthcare services, to reimagine and transform their entire IT organization through our living systems approach. We are leveraging new ways of working in agile foundations to capture efficiencies and reduce costs, while positioning the company for growth and diversification to drive business resilience. With our managed security services, we are helping a central bank in Asia to strengthen their resilience against cyber threats, builds in the flexibility to securely grow their payment transactions from millions to billions at speed and scale. Our Industry X team is helping Formula One re-launch its F1 TV Grand Prix racing product. By using the cloud-based Accenture video solution, live streams from 20 trackside and onboard cameras and a growing range of connected devices, we are continuously innovating to embed intelligence in their platforms to deliver the best possible viewer experience. Now, let me turn to Accenture’s greatest and undeniable competitive advantage, our nearly 537,000 people. They are at the heart of our outstanding results. Fundamental to our core values is to care deeply for our people and we placed significant importance on providing a meaningful employee experience. For almost every person around the world, living and working during the pandemic has been challenging. To help our people succeed both professionally and personally during this time, we have put in place many programs. For example, we are partnering with Bright Horizons in the U.S. through development of an innovative program for school aged children to receive proctoring for their virtual studies and homework. We have extended telemedicine to parents of our employees in India and we are providing industry leading mental wellness programs, including Thriving Mind, a holistic well-being program that teaches us about the science behind stress and how to recharge your brain’s battery. We are proud that more than 160,000 of our people have completed the program with impressive results, including nearly 9 out of 10 participants reported feeling significantly better able to handle challenges in the workplace. Equally important is our focus on vibrant career paths. We have maintained pay increases, bonuses and promotions both in our normal December time period as well as an added round of promotions in February, enabling us to promote in total at the same level as the prior year. Additionally, we will expand our regular midyear promotions this coming June to include managing directors, a first in our company’s history as one more way, we continue to create new opportunities for our people. And today, we are announcing a special one-time bonus for all of our people below managing director to recognize the contributions and dedication to our clients during this difficult year. Continuous learning also is a defining feature of Accenture. We continued to invest in our people and their market leading skills, with a 28% increase in training hours and 25% increase in hours per person just this quarter. And coming back to our ability to attract talent, we know that people want to work for companies that not only create value, but also lead with values. We are proud this quarter to have been named for the 14th consecutive year on Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies list and for the 19th consecutive year on Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies. Our strategic decision to preserve our talent last year, including our recruiters, provided a strong base to meet the surge in demand we have experienced. Recruiting, hiring and managing supply and demand has always been a core competency and we are confident in our ability to attract talent and continue to meet the increased demand. We increased hiring approximately 50% both year-over-year and since last quarter. And we have on-boarded over 100,000 people virtually over the last 12 months, with new innovative approaches. I would like to recognize the extraordinary leadership and efforts of our Chief Leadership and Human Resources Officer, Ellyn Shook and her outstanding team around the globe for how they have helped care for our people throughout the pandemic, guided us through health and safety of COVID, are ensuring that we are continuously reskilling our people and have helped us manage and realize the incredible expansion of our talent to meet the needs of our clients. Over to you, KC, for a look ahead.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal ‘21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $12.55 billion to $12.95 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 4.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal ‘20 and reflects an estimated 10% to 13% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year ‘21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 3% compared to fiscal ‘20. For the full fiscal ‘21, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% growth in local currency over fiscal ‘20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel, based on a 2% reduction in the first half of the year and no material impact in the second half of the year. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year ‘21 to be 15% to 15.1%, a 30 to 40 basis point expansion of our fiscal ‘20 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal ‘20. For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal ‘21 to be in the range of $8.67 to $8.85. We now expect adjusted full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.32 to $8.50 or 12% to 14% growth over adjusted fiscal ‘20 results. For the full fiscal ‘21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $7.65 billion to $8.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.3 to 1.4. Finally, we now expect to return at least $5.8 billion, an increase of $500 million through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. With that, let’s open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?\nAngie Park: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask the questions. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hey, thanks. Terrific results here. I can’t remember. I was thinking the last time you guys raised your margin outlook, especially against such strong bookings and investments like cloud first, you talked about plus this one-time bonus to employees, etcetera? So what’s different this time to allow you to do that to raise margins modestly against some good momentum here? And I will ask my follow-up just together with this, which is given the big bookings, thinking about contract execution, do you feel good about sort of the level of expectations you need to deliver here to keep this momentum going, because I know you put a lot of hard work into driving up the bookings here, but I am curious if there is anything different to consider here with contract execution looking ahead? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Okay. Thanks, Tien-tsin. So in terms of operating margins, let me just cover with you what’s the driver this year of our 30 to 40 basis points operating margin expansion. And you are right it is unusual for us to expand our operating margin halfway through the year. And so implied in our guidance for the year, there is obviously continued healthy margin expansion in the back half. That’s in addition, Tien-tsin to the 40 basis points that we have already done year-to-date. And then as I mentioned, which does include the impact of the one-time bonus that we are doing for employees below managing director. And I will just maybe highlight a few things in terms of drivers for the expansion this year. I mean, as always, we first look to strong revenue growth and we have that again this year. And that’s coming along with increased contract profitability. We do have increased contract profitability coming through in our gross margin in the first half of the year and that’s really the first lever that we always look at. Within this year uniquely are a couple of things. One is utilization. So, we are getting some additional margin expansion this year based on our higher utilization rate. We talked about that last quarter that we are looking to bring that down to more normal levels. It did go up this quarter. We are still working on that. But clearly, in the first half of the year and into the second half, there will be some benefit to operating margin expansion on that. And the second part is due to the lower travel events and meetings of spend this year. So, we are going to benefit from that overall for the full year, but that benefit really is in the first half of the year. As the baseline last year in the back half is as you know, we really didn’t travel or have meetings, so it’s not a benefit that we will have in the back half of the year. And so I think overall, the key thing though in operating margin is that we always look to drive strong underlying profitability, because we want to ensure that we are investing first in our business because we want to drive long-term shareholder value. And so that’s really the critical part that we are able to continue to invest in our business and in our people and in acquisitions, but while at the same time expanding operating margin significantly.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And Tien-tsin, why don’t I take the – I will take the question about execution, we are very confident about our ability to execute. And let me just remind you that one of the things that’s really benefiting us is just our absolute excellent performance when the pandemic started and we had to move all of our people from our centers, while our clients were having to move remotely. As you will recall, I shared that we closed the books for 70 public companies and we did so without missing a beat that we on average pre-pandemic, have a new release every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day, on the technology say 7 days a week and we have continued with that execution. And in fact, one of the things that we believe is driving our growth is that we enhanced our standing with our clients because of how we have been able to execute, while at the same time, we help many of them move online. So we feel very good. Our centers and our people across the globe in terms of delivery are just amazing. And I should thank them, because at the end of the day, that’s what really matters for our people and we really just have exceptional people.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes, thanks both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hey, good morning. Nice results here. Julie, I wanted to kind of rewind the clock back to early 2020, which obviously feels like eons ago now, but when you reorganized Accenture to pivot to more focus on the geographies and geographic expansion. Now that we’re a year plus in and the dust had settled a little bit, can you just kind of bring us back to that and reflect on what’s working well with that pivot, what’s working maybe less well, or it’s been more challenging than you expected. And what’s different about operating in growth markets? Just realizing that those – that the growth markets are an important part of the growth story for Accenture going forward. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. Great question. One of the things that we look back on internally as a leadership team was that we actually were very bold in our ambition in my first year as CEO to actually put that new model in place only 6 months into the fiscal year and change our P&L in the middle of the fiscal year. And we look back and often use it as a lesson as to speed matters because as you think about our execution during the last 12 months, we did so with a new leadership team and a new way of working. And what it really demonstrated was we made the right strategic move. Driving the move from industry to geography were a few things. And remember, what we did was we also put digital everywhere. So we simplified because digital is now the core of our business. But the first thing is what we call the Client Proximity Imperative. We had such scale in all of our markets. We wanted to put our leaders really closer to our clients, while at the same time really enhancing the ability to move innovation around the world. And we did that by massively simplifying. And so we – at the one hand, where – we made a geographic P&L. But on the other hand, we made critical changes to actually make it easier to move innovation around the world. And secondly, we felt as if the ability to simplify and then have teams come together across our services would really unlock value. And of course, you did that before we had COVID, but we’ve seen the acceleration of the need for that because our clients are really looking for ability to bring outcomes. And so just think about the work that we are doing right now. Like I take BBVA, which you may know, it’s a customer-centric global financial services company headquartered in Spain. And we have worked with them to move – they wanted to increase their digital sales. And that brings together operation, all of our interactive capabilities, like paid media, search engine optimization, analytics and marketing operation, plus our deep industry experience. And with our support over the last 12 months, they have grown their digital sales more than 50% and they saw an increase in digital customers by more than 50%. The ability to bring those services together seamlessly to deliver those outcomes has really been enabled by that growth model that both simplified, recognize that the core of our business is now digital cloud and security, and enable us to really meet the needs of the client globally. In terms of growth markets, there is really nothing different there. I mean the geographic model helps us both focus on the opportunity in each of the markets, while at the same time, really connecting the innovation and being able to serve global clients better.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks. Maybe my quick follow-up is maybe for KC, a follow-up on Tien-tsin’s question. I know you said you’re – yes, you’re running a little hot on utilization right now. And you commented on that as well last quarter. I’m curious though, with the shift to remote work, one, do you think that shift is going to remain more permanent? And will it allow you to actually maintain a higher level of utilization on a more permanent basis?\nKC McClure: Yes. So thanks, Lisa, for the question. Yes, I will just reiterate. We are trying to – we are working to get it back – our utilization back into a more normal range as they did tick up this quarter. And this really is tied to the increased demand that came back harder than we expected, right? So – but we continue to believe that the right answer for our people is to lower it back into our more normal historical ranges. And in terms of the structural – is there a structural change? I believe, just now that over time, there is really not a structural change in utilization. There is probably some increase right now due to remote working, but we don’t see on a go forward any long-term structural change in our utilization rate.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And just to remember, Lisa, like we have a very important value proposition that includes being able to do continuous learning, but also the right level of time to do strategic thinking, for example, and to come together around important initiatives. And so that’s why we believe that, over time, we really should get back into kind of a more normal regardless of where people are working from.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Julie. Hi, KC. Congratulations. These are tremendous results.\nJulie Sweet: Hi, Ashwin.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Just I hate to keep bringing up margin again and again. But one thing I did not necessarily hear you explicitly call out was pricing, which you might expect given sort of a price for value component, given the pivot, the mix, as you primarily do digital cloud and security, and also, frankly, a shortage of resources. It was also going to be my follow-up question, is that your attrition has ticked up, but still below historical levels. I see all the steps you took towards employee health, wellness, eventually controlling attrition. But as demand accelerates across the industry, do you expect inflation to return to historical, like mid upper teens type levels?\nKC McClureb: Yes. So Thanks, Ashwin, for the question. So I’ll cover the pricing point, and I’ll hand it over to Julie to talk about attrition. So maybe let’s start with context overall and what we’re seeing in the overall market and the business environment. So as we have been saying and we continue to see that the business environment does remain competitive and in some areas, we experienced pricing pressure, but we are seeing signs of stability, right? So that’s probably the first key point. In terms of the pricing that we have across our different markets or our services, as you know, the pricing can vary depending on what it is that we’re selling and in what markets that we’re doing that commercial arrangement. But what is important, what stays the same is that we always look to make sure that we are doing a smart commercial arrangement that benefits both our clients and Accenture. And that’s a key part of our 360-degree value. But as it relates to what we’re actually delivering in terms of profitability, I do want to highlight that within our operating margin and within gross margin, we did, we haven’t expanded the delivery of client profitability and contract profitability. So that’s a key part of our operating margin expansion for the year. And Julie, you want to talk about attrition?\nJulie Sweet: Yes Ashwin. Look, I think it’s – I think we would expect that we’re going to go back to sort of industry norms on attrition, although we will always work hard to not do that, right. And we do believe that we’re benefiting right now from the way we have cared for and – our people and the decisions we made to preserve our talent and invest in keeping them through the lower demand areas. So – but certainly, we’re tuned as a company to be able to grow and recruit at this level and at the more normal levels, as you said, in the higher teens.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Good result.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys and congratulations from me as well. Just thinking, Julie, about this more structurally longer term, is this growth rate – the back half growth rate obviously being really strong in the back half, double-digit growth, implied for both the third and the fourth quarter. How has the pandemic changed things that this could be maybe more sustainable than just kind of a onetime pickup in growth and maybe the growth could be? I know we’ve talked about in the past 5% to 8% constant currency growth. Just wondering if that formula has potentially changed in the future due to the pull forward of some of the digital transformation from the pandemic?\nKC McClure: So we knew someone was going to try to get us to look ahead for next year, but…\nBryan Keane: You got me.\nKC McClure: So but we’re not going to. But let me just – so instead of trying to look ahead to next year and thinking about it, let’s maybe just focus on how we are looking at our business right now. So if you think about the last 6 years when we started digital, we rotated our business so that now the core of our business is digital, cloud, security and all of our services, meaning not just – that’s not from a technical perspective. And so think about what we have built are engines of growth as the core of our business, which is what we went through when you think about cloud, Industry X, applied intelligence, operation, the things we went through on our script today. And so we have these engines of growth which we continue to invest in. And I think what’s really important in the way we think about our business is we’re – for example, cloud, we already scaled. We told you last quarter, it was $12 million in FY ‘20 but it’s growing double-digits because we’re at the very early stages of it. And when you think about Accenture Cloud First, we brought together, right, all of our services, from strategy and consulting, to experience, to cloud, industry experience, because not only are companies having to migrate to the cloud, but they need to create value, like we’re working with an American entertainment company, where we’re helping them use – leverage the cloud to accelerate the time to market of new video services, right? So it’s not about the migration. It’s about the value. And so think about our business as having built these engines of growth, some of which already have massive scale and are continuing. And then others, like Industry X, Industry X is a way that we are going to continue to diversify our revenue sources for resilience over the long-term. We made two acquisitions this quarter, [indiscernible] Solutions and Myrtle Consulting Group, to help build our manufacturing and supply chain. We’re going to continue to invest there. We think about that as the next interactive, right, in terms of building this new area. And we’re at this amazing tipping point right now where we’re seeing an acceleration of digitization in manufacturing and in product engineering. And so we continue to think about how do we both make sure these growth engines is going, but never have to have another rotation because we’re always investing. And I mean, the last point I would just say is our capacity to invest in acquisitions has been a huge differentiator in building the business we have today, as being the core of our business is now these engines of growth. And we continue to execute on that in all of our major strategic areas and the next scale plays. And I’d call out the two we made this quarter in cloud, for example, Infinity Works and Edenhouse.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Got it. And just KC, a quick follow-up, will travel and reimbursables, will that go up back to the norms of previous past? I’m just trying to figure out if some of that, obviously – some of that travel work doesn’t have to continue until the model slightly changes on that front.\nKC McClure: Yes. So that’s a great question, Bryan. So let me just first tell you what we’ve assumed as it relates to kind of our revenue. So we do not have in our revenue guidance an increase in travel revenue from travel-related expenses. Now obviously, we’re continuing to meet with our clients and do well, and engage with them, as you can see from our record bookings and our really strong revenue growth. But we don’t have any of that in – we don’t have that significantly embedded in our revenue. In terms of for the rest of the year, we’ll continue to see where we are with the travel and expand events and meetings. As we go throughout the rest of the year and into next year, so it’s kind of too early to tell. Julie, if you want to add anything?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. I agree. I mean, look, I’m having lots of conversations with companies who are just trying to figure this out, right? Will travel – will it actually explode once people feel safe because they need to reconnect? Will it structurally shift? And I would say that it’s really – we think it’s too early and company, it’s really kind of allover the map. And that hopefully will have a lot better sense as we get through the next 6 months. And we see vaccination variance and healthy – how comfortable people are. But it’s still pretty unclear.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Hey, guys. Thanks, nice job. And I guess my first question, outsourcing growth was the strongest, I think, in 6 years, and that’s really not on an easy comp either. You had a pretty normal Q2 of last year in terms of growth. I’m wondering, is there something within outsourcing that has kind of step function change to just a better level than normal or something happening there that’s really triggering growth in such a stable part of your business typically?\nJulie Sweet: Well, it’s a great question. And this really is a big driver of how well we’re doing now because in this – when you have compressed transformation where the companies need to do so much at the same time, there is a really sharp focus on, what do I need to do? How do I source the talent, right? And that conversation has absolutely gone faster. But also, how can I digitize every part of the organization? And what Accenture has, which is very unique, is this investment we’ve been making for years in the SynOps platform, for example, in operations, and in technology, things like myWizard and myConcerto, which builds in best-of-class AI, machine learning, rapid testing. And these are platforms that we continuously invest in. And so when you – happening is here is that we’re helping them digitize. We are helping them focus on, what do they really need to have in-house versus can leverage in order to go faster. But one thing I want to be really, really clear about is, although our strategy and consulting business continued to have a high single-digit decline, it was better than we expected, strategy and consulting is absolutely essential to all of these results, including outsourcing. Because what we are bringing to them, right? It’s not simply always at a lower cost. It’s increase is in sales through our marketing operations, like the BBVA example I gave, right? It’s manufacturing in at AIG, which I talked about, it’s insurance, right, as well as deep process skills. It is helping them transform the ways they are working by being integrated with us where we’re bringing modern ways of working and digital. And so this is what distinguishes us as a company for our clients. It’s not – you for guys, it’s type of work, outsourcing versus consulting, which is basically managed services, it’s project work. For our clients, it’s our ability to bring all these services together, which is why I emphasize that each of the examples I gave in my script, and I gave you many more, really are polling all of these things together for an outcome and when you are going to compress transformation, that’s more important than ever.\nDave Koning: Great, thanks. That’s great. And I guess my just quick follow-up. Every vertical accelerated in the quarter except for resources. And so I’m just wondering, on that vertical specifically, that got a little worse, but that hits really easy comps in the back half, anything to kind of call out there on momentum kind of reaccelerating in the future?\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks, Dave. So resources, it came in, in the zone that we expected it to. And I’d just point out a couple of things. So we’ve talked about the industry is more impacted by the pandemic, and resources clearly has one of those, which is energy and that continued to be under pressure. And I would also say that our clients in the chemical industry also have been feeling some pressure as well but we have seen stability in our utilities portfolio which is good. And go forward, as we look into Q3, we do see an improvement in the resources growth rate.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And by the way, this is where Industry X is going to be so critical. For example, we’re working with a North America, one of the largest oil integrators in the world, in re-imagining their plants from both health and safety security and efficiency perspective. I was just in our brand-new OT security lab in Houston last week. Yes, I actually did go on a business trip. And a big focus of OT security is across all of our volt process and discrete manufacturing. So there – obviously, as an industry – set of industries, they have been impacted. But if you think about where we’re focused and how we’re going to help them from efficiency and safety and security, it’s great. We’re well positioned.\nDave Koning: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. And wanted to go back to one of the comments you made in the prepared remarks in terms of increasing your programmatic B&A. And wondering if you could just give us a little color of how we should think about contribution from that, specific areas of focus, durability, etcetera. Just trying to understand how you are thinking about that initiative, which seems really important?\nKC McClure: Yes. So thanks for the question. You’re absolutely right. I mean, our ability to invest significantly in our business, and that includes B&A, is a key competitive advantage. And I would just say, we’ve been at this for a long time, to your point. It’s been a core part of our strategy since 2013. On average, we’ve done about 20% of our operating cash flow to B&A, and that’s our updated guidance of about up to $2 billion – at least $2 billion, puts us in that same zone. So – but it’s not just being able to acquire. It’s successful integration. And so you can see that, that typically provides about 2% of inorganic contribution in this year. It’s going to be more, in the 2.5% zone. So we really are very focused on that as a key part of our strategy, and we will look to continue to invest. And as we’ve said, we can always – we can do more than the $2 billion if the opportunity presents itself, but it is a key part of our investment portfolio.\nJames Faucette: Thanks. And just turning operationally for my follow-up question, can you give some color on how much of the strong demand that you’re seeing is driven by your partner network this year? And where you’re seeing most strength there? And I guess, how you would think about that part of business generation evolving over the next few quarters and periods?\nJulie Sweet: Our ecosystem partners are absolutely essential to our growth. I called them out in our script. We’re really proud to be the number one or number two partner, with all of the major ecosystem partners. And what we uniquely bring is, because of the strength of our relationships, we can really bring integrated value propositions to our clients. And so, those relationships are very high priority and to – and important to our future growth.\nJames Faucette: Thanks, Julie. Thanks, KC.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nAngie Park: Operator, we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Question on the outsourcing and operation strength, so you highlighted the AIG Shared Services deal this quarter, have you seen a pickup in captive acquisition opportunities that you’ve acted upon here over the last several quarters? And I’m curious how we should think about this mix contributing to your outperformance and the pipeline going forward?\nJulie Sweet: Well, we’ve shared in prior calls that we do see more interest in captives. We’re starting to see us execute on some of them. But I think it’s too early to say whether that’s going to be a big part of the mix or not. For the reasons I’ve talked about, we can go in and help digitize. KC, do you want to add anything?\nKC McClure: No. I would just say, in terms of what we see, in terms of the mix, for H2, we still see a double-digit growth in outsourcing. And for the full year, I think they will end up with high single to low double-digit positive growth in terms – to give you some sense of the mix.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, I appreciate that. And then just on H&PS and Financial Services, so those both clearly had outsized performance in the quarter. Can you just talk about the key contributors underlying those two?\nKC McClureb: Yes. So, we were really pleased with H&PS and Financial Services growth this quarter. H&PS continues to be growth that we’ve seen in public service and the work that we’ve been doing during – not just only, but clearly led by a lot of the work that we’re doing within the COVID space. And then in financial services, we’re pleased that we do have strength in our banking and capital markets, and that’s a statement globally as it relates to – particularly – and not only in our business in Europe, but all over, including North America. So very strong performance in both of those, and we expect that to continue.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And it’s the things that are – it’s cloud, right. It’s – there is a big movement to cloud. It’s digital experience. It’s more like the example I gave in BBVA. It’s basically all the trends that we’ve talked about are playing out really across industry and financial services is one of the less – more moderate impacted industries, and they are investing.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you very much.\nJulie Sweet: Okay, great. Well, thank you again for joining today. And thank you again to all of our incredible people around the globe. And as always, I just want to end by thanking our shareholders for your continued trust in us. May everyone stay well and healthy.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference.

Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet : Thank you, Angie, and thank you everyone for joining us. We had another outstanding quarter reflecting our laser focus on creating 360 degree client value and the importance of our scale, experience, industry knowledge and trust to the world's leading companies and governments as they continue to digitally transform their enterprises.  We had a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million and a total of $15.4 billion in bookings. We delivered 16% revenue growth in local currency, 3% above the top of our guided range with outstanding profitability and free cash flow. We estimate that we continue to take significant market share.  Our growth was broad based across geographic markets and industries with 11 out of 13 industries growing double digits this quarter and reflects our ability to bring together our unmatched breadth of services from strategy and consulting to interactive technology and operations to create the solutions which achieve the value and speed that makes a difference to our clients. We continue to meet our clients’ strong demand adding a net 32,000 talented people this quarter alone. We offer an employee value proposition that allows us to attract top talent, develop our people with world class training and provide them with vibrant career paths. We are pleased with our record 117,000 promotions year-to-date, including almost 1,200 promotions to Managing Director, and while delivering these results we have raised the bar again in terms of investment.  We now expect to invest about $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this fiscal year with 39 acquisitions closed or announced year-to-date. This includes announcing this quarter, two acquisitions with purchase prices over $1 billion each. The acquisition by Accenture Federal Services of Novetta in the U.S., an advanced analytics company which we expect to close in August, and with Umlaut, a world class engineering services company headquartered in Germany, which we expect to close in Q1. These 39 acquisitions are well balanced with 10 in North America, 17 in Europe, and 12 in growth markets.  Our level of investment demonstrates as well how scale, experience and trust matters. Scale, in terms of our financial capacity; experience, in terms of our track record of the successful integration of approximately 200 companies since 2013, and the trust we have earned in the market that attracts leading companies to want to join the Accenture family. We invest in acquisitions to scale in areas where we see a big market opportunity, to add skills and new capabilities and to further deepen our industry and functional expertise, all to drive continued innovation and the next waves of growth.  Finally, because we believe strongly in our commitment to share its success with our communities, we recently announced that we would donate $100 for every one of our zen 540,000 employees or $54 million to urgently address the needs of our communities due to pandemic, including $25 million for India.  KC, over to you. \nKC McClure : Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. As you heard in Julie’s comments, we are extremely pleased with our results in the third quarter, which continue to reflect very strong momentum across all dimensions of our business. Based on the strength of our third quarter results, and the confidence we have in our fourth quarter to continue to expand our market leadership position, we are increasing our full year outlook which I will cover in more detail later in the call.  Before I get into the details, let me summarize the major headlines of our third quarter results, which reflect continued superior execution against our three financial imperatives.  Revenue increased nearly $2.3 billion, reflecting growth of 16% in local currency. Results were approximately $300 million above the top end of our guided range, driven by broad based over performance across the business with double digit growth in all three markets, four of five industry groups and in technology services and operations.  As we expected, both strategy and consulting and the resources industry group returned to grow. These results demonstrate the power of our business model and our unique ability to seamlessly integrate our services at scale. We estimate that our growth continues to significantly outpace the market.  Operating margin was 16%, an increase of 40 basis points for the quarter. Importantly, we no longer have the margin expansion tailwind from lower travel as we anniversary the benefit of the compare this quarter. We continue to absorb significant investments in our people and our business as we are always focused on positioning our business for the future, and we delivered very strong EPS of $2.40, up 26% over fiscal ‘20.  Finally, we delivered strong free cash flow of $2.2 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion year-to-date while also continuing all elements of our capital allocation program, including returning roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this quarter via dividends and share repurchases. We've made investments of $1.5 billion in acquisitions through Q3 and we now expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year, which does not include the Umlaut acquisition which we anticipate to close in FY’22.  I want to take a moment to highlight that as you can see from our results and guidance this year, we are able to step up our acquisition spend and continue to expand operating margin. And while I won't comment on the specifics of FY ‘22 until September, based on our current line of sight, you should think of next year's inorganic contribution in the range of 4% and we expect margin – modest margin expansion as we continue to run our business with rigor and discipline.  With that, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $15.4 billion for the quarter, with a very strong book-to-bill of 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2.  We were very pleased with our new bookings, which represent 39% growth in U.S. dollars and reflect a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. Each service dimension; strategy and consulting, technology services and operations delivered double digit bookings growth in local currency.  Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, a 21% increase in U.S. dollars and a 16% increase in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 21% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6 billion, up 20% U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency.  Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, operations grew very strong double digit, technology services grew strong double digits, and strategy and consulting grew high single digits.  Turning to our geographic markets, in North America revenue growth was 18% local currency, driven by double digit growth in public service, software and platforms and consumer goods, retail and travel services. In Europe, revenues grew 14% local currency. We saw double digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services and industrial, and high single digit growth in banking and capital markets.  Looking closer at the countries, Europe was driven by double digit growth in the U.K., Italy and Germany. In growth markets we delivered 15% revenue growth in local currency, led by double digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, banking and capital markets and public service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double digit growth in Japan and Brazil.  Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.2% compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. Sales and market expense for the quarter was 10.6% compared with 10.2% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense is 6.6% compared to 6.3% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16% operating margin, up 40 basis points compared with Q3 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared with an effective tax rate of 25.5% for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.40 compared to EPS of $1.90 in the third quarter last year. Day Service Outstanding were 36 days compared to 34 days last quarter and 41 days in the third quarter of last year.  Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion, net of property and equipment editions of $158 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $10 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at August 31.  With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $835 million at an average purchase price of $276.98 per share. As of May 31 we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend $0.88 per share for a total of $559 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year, and our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share to be paid on August 13, also a 10% increase over last year.  So in summary, we are extremely pleased with our results to-date, and are now focused on Q4 and closing out a very strong year. Now, let me turn it back to Julie. \nJulie Sweet : Thanks KC. I’ll start with the environment. The dynamics in the market we are seeing are not only of recovery from the lower spending pattern at the onset of the pandemic, but a more sustained growth in demand as companies race to modernize and accelerate their digital initiatives with compressed transformation.  Pre-COVID our research showed a digital achievement gap with leaders growing 2x faster than laggers and we estimate that gap has now widened to 5x, with leaders stepping up their investment in technology and innovation, and lead progress taking accelerated steps to catch up.  Cloud is an even more critical enabler as companies are increasing their focus on enterprise wide transformations and rapidly moving to digital and cloud powered models. These needs of our clients are driving strong momentum in our business, with an acceleration of continued strong double digit growth across Applied Intelligence, Cloud, Industry X, Intelligent Operations and Security, with interactive and intelligent platform services returning to strong double digit growth this quarter. These strategic priorities are multi-service and are powered by our unparalleled technology ecosystem relationship.  Let me share some color to bring this demand to life. I want to particularly highlight Cloud, which continues to have very strong double digit growth rates, as well as the subset of Accenture Cloud First with growth was even stronger and has exceeded our expectations when we formed Cloud First last September. With our Cloud First services we are helping agencies served by concept, Italy's National Procurement Agency to deliver on Italy's National Recovery and Resilience Plan. We are developing and running industry specific cloud based platforms to standardize and improve their efficiency and speed, reducing the time to launch new contracts and ultimately providing much improved services for Italy’s citizens.  We are using our Intelligent Platform services to help DuPont, a company with a rich history of business reinvention. We imagine its financial structure to coordinate operations across its large geographic footprint. After going through a strategic and deliberate restructuring through M&A, we will now help DuPont implement essential finance processing suites that will help them to consolidate their multiple financial systems and chart of accounts into one and close the books faster. This will provide real-time review of results for all of the business units, all in the cloud, giving DuPont more agility, speed and certainty in a complex and volatile market.  We are helping Jaguar Land Rover transform its global marketing model to deliver a more personalized customer experience with creativity and technology at its core. We were selected for our technology capabilities, data led performance and experience led approach. We will use the strength of the experience, creative and digital capabilities of interactive, and the marketing delivery capabilities of operations with our SynOps platform, which we already used as part of Jaguar Land Rover warranty operations. SynOps  will deliver AI powered insights and highly automated production around the world.  Security is top of mind for our clients as the threat landscape expands. Our very strong double digit growth is driven by the breadth and depth of our services, from advisory to cyber defense, to managed security. For example, facing ever increasing cyber threats and continued financial pressures as a result of COVID-19, Accenture is helping a UKI bank by bringing together the whole breadth of these capabilities to provide innovative solutions to support the bank's future security strategy.  Across many of these examples are our implied intelligence services. We were excited this quarter to announce Accenture federal services agreement to acquire Novetta, an advanced analytics company serving U.S. Federal Organizations that is demonstrating what's possible with analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering. This will augment our already strong capabilities and scale in these critical areas, providing even more diversification across our federal business, specifically in the national security space which is seeing substantial growth.  I wanted to give a special recognition to our colleagues serving the public sector around the world throughout the pandemic. Your seven consecutive quarters of double digit growth reflect your absolute commitment to the important missions of government serving their citizens.  Turning now to Industry X, our digital, engineering and manufacturing services. We believe that product development, design engineering, manufacturing and the supply chain make up the next big digital transformation frontier. The impact of COVID-19 is accelerating the need to transform these core operations, and for nearly a decade we have been investing to build the unique capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to combine the power of data and digital with traditional engineering services.  We are very pleased with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Umlaut, which will add more than 4,200 industry leading engineers and consultants across 17 countries, and expand our capabilities across a range of industries, including automotive, aerospace and defense, telecommunications, energy and utilities.  Some recent examples of our Industry X services include helping a German telecom company continuously develop and enhance their internet television service by utilizing embedded engineering in their set top boxes and managing new features on the platform. Helping a large media conglomerates accelerate their primary revenue streams and digital products and advertising, with our product and platform engineering expertise to design, build, test and deploy new products, services and features; and working with a global automotive OEM to execute online remote software updates for their in-car computer systems to allow seamless deployment of new software versions.  We are also working with an American multinational manufacturer of confectionery pet food and other food products to deploy a digital twin platform to optimize production in its manufacturing facilities, improve margins and reduce waste. We’re working with a large electric company in Japan to help their power plants – to help bring their power plants into the future by digitizing their operations and standards across each department. And with a large oil and gas company to build their internal digital capabilities to substantially reduce time to market for new digital solutions that extends to its customers while supporting the company's key safety and sustainability goals throughout the use of the digital factory.  Taking a step back, the examples I have provided today, all require deep industry knowledge and innovation. Our breadth and depth across industries enables us to tailor industry solutions, while bringing cross industry expertise as we help our clients facing industry convergence and by using the lessons of other industries. We are proud this quarter that Fast Company recognized us for our innovation across multiple initiatives in its World Changing Ideas Awards. Our cross-industry expertise is one of the powerful sources of our ability to innovate.  For example, using our deep banking industry and technical expertise, we rapidly developed for a commercial bank which was not a traditional small business administration lender; a program under the U.S. paycheck protection program that allowed them to make loans to thousands of small businesses struggling with the impacts of the pandemic. We then pivoted to apply this approach to stand up’s Facebook’s small business grants program for black owned businesses, enabling the distribution of 10,000 grants to black-owned businesses in the U.S. This grants program is an important part of Facebook's overall commitment to invest $200 million in building programs and tools for black owned businesses.  Finally, let me turn to our incredible people. Their health and safety remain our top priority. We are supporting our people by facilitating vaccinations, including standing up clinics in many of our offices such as in India where already 50,000 of our people, their families and contractors have been vaccinated.  We have been focused on taking the lessons as an almost 100% remote workforce during the pandemic to a new way of working, moving from a remote or hybrid model to an omni-connected experience. People will work in the office, from home and at client sites, and its likely many of our clients will be doing the same. So our approach focuses on the experience of connecting to continue to serve our clients in a differentiated way and create an environment that our people feel a sense of belonging.  The rich diversity and ingenuity of our people from our Board of Directors to our new hires, helps us deliver 360 degree value for the benefit of all. We now have more than 250,000 women representing approximately 46% of our workforce. As you may recall, shortly after the murder of George Floyd in the U.S., on this call I shared with you our commitment to take three actions in the U.S.: setting external goals to increase representation, training our people and making a bigger impact in our communities.  One year later I am pleased to report that we not only took each action, but have made measurable progress, including increasing our representation, having 95% of our U.S. people complete our new anti-racism training and making substantial new investments in our communities. You can find a full progress update on our website, because we believe transparency and accountability are hallmarks of good governance and essential to building trust.  As we see the rise or continuation of all kinds of hate crimes against diverse communities, including violence against Asians, the LGBTI community, antisemitism and Islamophobia, I want to reaffirm my and Accenture’s unwavering commitment to equality and justice for all and zero tolerance for racism, bigotry and hate of any kind.  KC, back to you. \nKC McClure: Thanks Julie. Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal ’21, we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be positive 4% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘20 and reflects an estimated 17% to 21% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year ’21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 3.5% compared to fiscal ‘20.  For the full fiscal ’21, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 10% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal ’20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel, based on a 2% reduction the first half of the year and no material impact in the second half of the year. Importantly, organic revenue is the driver of the increase to our updated guidance as we still expect the inorganic contribution to remain at about 2.5% for the full year.  For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year ‘21 to be 15.1% a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal ‘20 results. We now expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal ‘20.  For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal ‘21 to be in the range of $9.07 to $9.16. We now expect adjusted full year diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.71 to $8.80 or 17% to 18% growth over adjusted fiscal ‘20 results.  For the full fiscal ‘21 we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.65 billion to $9.15 billion. Property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.4 to 1.5.  Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $5.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.  With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?\nAngie Park: Thanks KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] It comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. \nLisa Ellis: Hey, good morning and thank you. Great results here! A couple of questions; one is a little more tactical, one more strategic. The first one, in bookings KC, can you just remind us one, how acquisitions are not reflected in bookings and then on a related note, is the composition of your bookings changing at all? I'm just specifically thinking about these big $100 million plus transformation programs. Are you seeing a notable change in duration or anything like that? Just trying to understand the booking number a little bit and then I’ll follow up. Thank you. \nKC McClure: Okay, great, thanks Lisa. So let me just decompose bookings a little bit. So we were really pleased with our bookings this quarter right, $15.4 billion, and again that grew 39% in U.S. dollars, really strong book-to-bill 1.2%. And in terms of – when you look at it, there was very strong bookings in both consulting and outsourcing, as well as all three geographic markets. And if you look at specifically in our V&A, which also was represented across all of those dimensions, there will be a slight impact in the bookings based on the backlog that we bring in from these acquisitions, but it's not overall significant. But let me just peel it back in terms of when you look underneath that 15.4, I’d say there's really kind of three things I’d point out. First was that there was really a good mix of all categories of our sales. As Julie mentioned, we had a record 20 clients, over $100 million of sales and that as you know positions us really well for the future. But if you go all the way down through the categories, all the way through our smaller deals, they’ve represented very well and that can help us with revenue in the current quarter.  The second thing that I would point out is that our bookings were very broad based across all of our services, and that include strategy and consulting. And the third thing was that it was aligned to our strategic priorities as we pointed out, you know driven by cloud industry [accent] (ph) security for example. So you know with those points I'll hand it back to you to ask the second question or if there's any other color that you want.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific! Thank you. The second one, maybe Julie this is for you. I just wanted – was hoping to comment on acquisitions. You know this is – obviously you’ve up-ticked acquisitions, made a couple of bigger ones than Accenture has historically done. Can you just talk about – you know is this just kind of opportunistic or has something kind of shifted in terms of your willingness to do larger acquisitions or specific market opportunities you're going after. Thank you. \nJulie Sweet: Sure Lisa. And well, so we've always said we have the capacity to do larger acquisitions, but we’re very disciplined about what we will acquire, and so these were you know opportunities that were very aligned to our strategic priorities.  So you know Novetta being both, investment and public sector, but primarily all about you know advanced analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering, and also importantly diversification for our federal business, because they are in the national intelligence space and Umlaut is in engineering, which was just an opportunity as a company that we know very well, that really is giving us an opportunity to accelerate our scale in Industry X and we've seen the digitization of manufacturing and engineering be a major priority post COVID.  Now we've been investing for nearly a decade in this space. We predicted this would happen. As you can see by the number, the amount of work that we're already doing, and this was a great opportunity for a company that we know well, and you know our strategy continues to be – we're going to make acquisitions to scale and big market opportunities to add new skills and opportunities as you know that we built a lot of interactive through acquisitions, for example those renewed skills and capabilities, and then to deepen industry and functional knowledge.  And so this is the continuation of that and you know I think the advantage we have is our financial capacity to make investments and to increase our investment you know for the benefit of our clients and all of our stakeholders when we see the right opportunities and we’re going to continue to have that discipline around making strategic acquisitions. \nLisa Ellis: Terrific! Good stuff. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead. \nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hey! Thanks and a great quarter. Congratulations on that from me as well. The question I had is about the momentum that you are seeing in the business and it seems to have actually accelerated from what you're seeing in the past quarters. I wanted to ask you with regards to whether this changes how you think about managing the business in the interim, in order to continue to deliver what you’re seeing from a demand perspective, particularly as we see attrition go up and so on and that's an across the board statement, not just an Accenture statement. So any thoughts with regards to how you're thinking of delivery?\nKC McClure: Yeah, Ashwin I’ll take this and maybe I'll frame up a few things for you and hand it over to Julie as well. So let me just maybe frame up how we’re thinking about you mentioned the demands you know in overall business and thinking about the quarter and our year-to-date from a financial perspective. You know these results are really exceptional when you think about it in the context of our historical performance, so I’ll start there. I mean clearly we’re benefiting from an easier compare in a strong market demand and we see that continuing, but even with that bookings at $44 billion growing 25% year-to-date and that’s off the base of record sales through Q3 last year. And then you couple that with 54 clients with bookings over $100 million through Q3, which is more in the first nine months of this year, than the whole of last year ‘20, FY‘20 and FY‘19 and I mention that as you talk about things in different ways, you may need to manage differently just to talk about the scale in our bookings. As we look at the scale in revenue, we grew record $2.3 billion in revenue this quarter year-over-year. When you think about our industries, where we’re clearly the leader with the breadth and depth of industries, with 11 of the 13 growing double digits and as I mentioned before in our guidance, the increase in our full year outlook, it's driven by organic revenue given that inorganic is contribution staying pretty much the same.  And then you end that all with profitability of 40 basis points expansion this quarter. We had very strong profitability and we're no longer benefiting from a travel tailwind and we continue to invest at scale in our business and our people. So you know with that, let me hand it over more to Julie to round out some of the question you had on demand and attrition.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, so Ashwin it’s a great question around you know managing our business and so I want to just take you all back to right before the pandemic. I remember back then and on March 1 we put in a new growth model we call the nextgen growth model and that was designed for helping us manage our business as we saw the scale increasing, right, and that change in growth model was focused on being able to have more of our leaders closer to our clients, we changed the P&L as you recall to the geographic.  And so we’ve already put in place a model that is designed to allow us to continue to scale, and so this for us was anticipated, and it’s exciting to see how we are very uniquely positioned as our clients’ needs have accelerated, because that’s what’s driving the demand right. The needs of our clients have accelerated post-COVID to do compressed transformation, and we have the right operating model in place.  As we think about attrition, you now it’s ticked up to pre-COVID levels in a hot market although not the highest we’ve ever seen, and so as you said it’s an industry phenomenon, we are comfortable – I mean our core competency is about managing our supply and demand, but more importantly our core competency is being a great company to work for. And as you saw with our numbers this quarter, we hired net 32,000 incredible people and that is just a testimony to our ability to attract great talent, as well as continue to train our people. We’ve trained over 100,000 people since the pandemic started, pivoting to the areas of our clients’ needs.  So we feel good about it, and of course this is what you expect from us, so we’ll continuously improve. \nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thanks for that. All good points and I agree. I guess the next question it with regards to you know – and ordinary I don’t focus on a particular acquisition, but this Umlaut seems to be, I have to ask is this the first of many as you expand into a much bigger engineering services type presence. That is a relatively massive end market, so just strategically how are you thinking of this? \nJulie Sweet: Well the sort of big picture, we believe that the digital engineering and manufacturing space is the next frontier for our clients, right. There’s been a lot and there’s still a lot to do with respect to the front office and the back office for lack of a better term, that you know our clients are building a digital core, they’re transforming operations and they’re trying to find new ways of growth. But the areas that have been not as digitized over the last several years as companies have pivoted, has been in core operations, manufacturing and supply chain.  Now we predicted this just as we predicted back in 2013, that someday everybody would be a digital business, and so we’ve been investing. We’ve already made, I don’t know, seven, eight, nine acquisitions over the last several years to build these capabilities, and you saw that with all the examples that we did in the script. And so this is about rapidly scaling with some of the best engineers in the world, right, because we see the market opportunity, but most importantly the need from our clients, and so you should expect that will continue to build these both organically and inorganically, but obviously this is a great add in terms of scale for us. \nAshwin Shirvaikar: Great! Thank you. Congratulations! \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJason Kupferberg : Thanks guys. Good morning. I’m wondering if you can estimate for us perhaps how much the acceleration in all this enterprise, digital transformation has enhanced your structural organic revenue growth profile, relative to pre-pandemic levels, because it certainly sounds like this trend continues to have lags. \nJulie Sweet: Yeah, I mean I think the way to think about it is that we’re taking market share and we are really well positioned to capture the growth that’s available because of the needs of our clients. And so you’re obviously seeing that uptick in organic growth and we think this will be sustained demand. I think it’s too early and we’re not going to kind of get back into sort of giving sort of a view of FY‘22, but what we would say is we do believe that what you’re seeing right now in demand isn’t just like you know a recovery because spending decreased, but actually sustained demand and that we are incredibly well positioned to capture that, because clients are looking for outcomes and the breadth of our services.  You know they’re turning to us because we can give them solutions, not just individual services. They want the innovation that we’re bringing; you know the things like our SynOps platform. They are very appreciative and focused on the fact that we care about the 360 degree value, so that we’re helping improve their own skills, as well as achieving their goals and finally, you know and I think something that is really critical right now and why we are so well positioned is they see it’s a company that creates value and leads with values.  And so trust really matters when you are doing major transformation and you know I’ll give you one example. We’ve had over 80 clients in the last 12 months just come and sit down with us to learn more about our diversity supplier program, because it really matters to them and they see us as a leader, right. These are the things that make us an incredibly attractive and trusted partner. And so we think that you know this is really an enduring differentiation at a time when there is going to be subsisting demand for compressed transformation. \nJason Kupferberg : Okay, understood. Just a quick two part follow up here, your thoughts on Q4 book-to-bill and what were the areas of the business that surprised you most in terms of revenue this quarter, because obviously the overall upside was quite significant. Thank you. \nJulie Sweet: Yes, Jason just in terms of how we think about the fourth quarter. I mean so obviously we’ve had $44 billion of booking year-to-date and even with that, we still have a strong pipeline and we feel good about our position for Q4 as it relates to bookings. And in terms of what did better, you know as I mentioned earlier, it really was broad based, every part of our business did a bit better. \nJason Kupferberg : Okay, thanks for the comments. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive. Please go ahead. \nRod Bourgeois: Hey guys! Hey, I just wanted to ask about the margin outlook given the increased acquisition contribution that you’ll be digesting in fiscal ‘22. I just like to ask about the margin levers that you’ll be able to pull in order to still achieve overall operating margin expansion. And also, I guess besides digesting this added acquisition content, are you also needing to spend more on people costs given the war for talent that’s out there. So question about margin levers and also the investments in people? Thanks. \nKC McClure: Yes, thanks Rod. So I mean, let’s start with the second one first. So yes, in terms of for the people side of it, obviously there’s a lot of demand in the market. We’re in a hot market right now and historically we’ve seen wages increase and that vary by skills and geographies and that’s happening now, but you see that Rod flowing through our results already to-date and through our guidance.  So it’s really up to us to manage our business with rigor discipline as we always do, you know us well, you know managing our pyramid, increasing the use of automation and just overall delivery efficiencies. So that’s the first part on wages as it relates to operating margin.  And just coming back to the same point on V&A, so let me just give you a little bit more color on V&A coupled with what I talked about a little bit earlier and of course, I’m not going to give any specific guidance for FY ‘22 until September. But we do expect to have a higher level of inorganic contribution next year, probably around something closer to 4% and that’s really due to the fact that we’re deploying about $4 billion in FY ‘21, a larger portion that’s closer to the later part of the year, and we expect to benefit from more of that revenue in FY ‘22.  We also expect at this time to deploy somewhere around $4 billion in FY ‘22, that’s including Umlaut, which we expect to close next year, early in the year. And of course as Julie said, we’ve always said we have the ability to do more, but that’s our line of sight today, and it’s up to us to manage our, to all the levers that we have in our disposal, to continue within the premise of clients and our overhead and structural costs, to make sure that we continue to drive modest margin expansion while investing at scale in our business and our people.\nRod Bourgeois: Great! And then just a quick follow-up on the revenue progression that’s happening. Clearly, this is a big industry recovery, some of that cyclical, some of it secular, and you have certain COVID-impacted verticals that are coming back online. I guess as we head into the next fiscal year, are there on the other side, are there any revenue contributions that will taper as the COVID crisis ends? Are there any, is there any sort of lumpy work that might taper off as you head into the next fiscal year amidst all of the other momentum that’s happening in the business?\nJulie Sweet: I mean there is nothing material. I mean like think about the public sector for example. We did a lot of COVID surge work, but now you’ve got the fiscal stimulus that’s around the world and you see the digitization of the public sector like we gave the example of concept in Italy. So there is nothing material that we think will be difficult to manage, because you’re seeing really, when you see that in the results, kind of across industries, there this need to digitize, so nothing material that we think to mention.\nRod Bourgeois: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Good morning, thank you. I’m curious, over the last two to three quarters, have you seen a notable change in clients’ appetite for price increases as broader transformation demand is ramped up?\nKC McClure: Yes, so let me talk to you a little bit about what we’re seeing in terms of pricing overall. So just importantly, as a reminder, we talked about pricing. We define it as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell Bryan. And as always the environment remains competitive, and in many areas of our business we did see pricing was lower and that’s really based on a combination of the fact that the market is competitive and disciplined investments that we’re making, and so all of that is baked into our operating margin guidance for the year.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then one on Accenture Operations, I’m curious if you’re seeing any change in the size and scope of engagements that clients are outsourcing too. Can you just comment on some of the strengths or the drivers of the continued strength that you’ve shown in that business?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, it’s a great question. It’s not so much about the size, it’s really about the intent. I mean what you’re seeing is clients really saying, in a world where I’ve got to digitize the entire enterprise, right, where do I want to focus my own resources and leadership and where can I leverage Accenture and their investments? And this is where we really got ahead of the market, right, where we developed SynOps and what we’re providing them is both cost efficiencies, but really outcomes of actual insights that come from being able to digitize. And then you add on top of that, where we have more clients thinking about having us takeover, we have a strong pipeline and you know taking over more people, because we have such a great employee value proposition and so they’re starting – you know when we think about the future of work, think about it, we’re seeing more of our clients really see it as a combination of their own employees automation or bots, and then partners like Accenture that really integrate with their own employees and we’re just a leader here. And so it’s more about the trends of the need to digitize that is what you’re seeing reflected, digitized at speed.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, congrats on the results. I wanted to ask about Strategy Consulting. It had been a laggard, but saw that it moved positively into high single-digit. Just a little bit on the outlook there. Do you continue to see that maybe reach some of the demand you’re seeing in some of your other industry groups?\nKC McClure: Yes. Hey, Bryan. Thanks for the question. You’re right, we were very pleased with the acceleration to high single-digits in the quarter in strategy consulting, which is what we expected. In terms of how we look at just consulting overall type of work go forward, we see it being strong double-digit for the fourth quarter and the second half of the year that would mean we round up really kind of at a strong double-digit growth perspective.\nJulie Sweet: And Bryan as a reminder, because I remind you all every single quarter, right, clients aren’t focused on is it strategy and consulting or technology or operations. They are looking for outcomes and what makes us so unique is that all of these things, whether it’s Cloud or Intelligent Operations or marketing transformation bring together our services and with more confidence and certainty and that’s really how we think about it.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And then just as a follow-up. The increase in M&A, just curious on how you guys are thinking about capital allocation, in particular the dividends and the share repurchase. Does that change at all with a little more M&A?\nKC McClure: Obviously, we’ll give you – I’ll give you specifics in September Bryan for next year, but overall our capital allocation framework really remains intact.\nJulie Sweet: I mean, you should all just think about this as we’re going to deliver on our commitments and we are investing to drive the next waves of growth and we are taking advantage of our ability to do so in this market.\nBryan Keane: Great! Thanks so much.\nAngie Park : Last question. Operator, we have time for one more question, then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you and that question will come from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hey! Thanks so much. Amazing results! Sorry if this was already asked, I had to jump off earlier. Just on the record number of deals over $100 million. I’m just curious how the pipeline is for such deals going forward. Is there an opportunity to replenish? Just what is the – what do you see out there in terms of large deal potential from here?\nKC McClure: Yes. Hey Tien-tsin, we still have a strong pipeline overall and that includes in the large deal category.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay, good. And then just on the four point inorganic contribution, I heard that for next year. How about on the margin impact there, I think KC you mentioned that there’ll be a little bit impact on the margin. You’ll still be able to expand. Just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yes. So yes, we want to – so what I did say is that we do expect inorganic contribution next year about 4% and our line of sight now is about $4 billion of capital spend next year ‘22, but we expect modest margin expansion to continue in ‘22.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay, very good. I appreciate that guys. Well done!\nKC McClure: Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Great, Tien-tsin. Okay, in closing, we really appreciate everyone joining us today. We believe that we are unique because of both what we do and how we do it and we are a company that as I’ve shared before, creates value and leads with values. I want to thank all of our people and our leaders for what you’re doing every day. And finally, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. We will make sure to earn it every day. Be well.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:00 AM Eastern today through September 23.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Angie Park, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAngie Park: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full fiscal 2021 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I am Angie Park, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results; KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning, before KC provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we will discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Angie, and everyone, for joining us. Before diving into our results, thank you to our 624,000 incredibly talented people around the world, including over 8,500 managing directors. This past fiscal year, your hard work and dedication to creating value that matters for our clients was unwavering, despite the ongoing and sometimes quite extreme challenges of COVID. We've had a truly extraordinary year, as reflected in our outstanding financial results and in the 360 degree value we delivered beyond our financials. From the over 120,000 promotions and over 31 million training hours, an increase of 43% for our people, to increasing our workforce by approximately 118,000 people, creating significant employment opportunities in our communities, to achieving 46% women on our way to our goal of gender parity by 2025, to our top three ranking in the Refinitiv Global Diversity and Inclusion Index, for the fourth consecutive year. To the number one position with our largest ecosystem partners, to the exciting accomplishment of 50% renewable energy now powering our offices and centers globally, to the donation of $54 million in COVID surge relief. In December, we will publish our first ever annual 360 degree value report to more fully describe the FY'21 value we created in all directions and we’ll report against three additional key ESG frameworks: SASB, TCFD, and WEF/IBC. We believe that the trust we have from our clients and partners, our continuous innovation, and our ability to consistently attract the best people, including the 56,000 net new hires this past quarter, are directly linked to our commitment to measuring our success by how well we create this 360 degree value for all our stakeholders, clients, people, partners, shareholders, and communities, and on our culture of shared success. Here are some key financial highlights of the year, which position us strongly as we begin FY'22. FY'21 demonstrated our leadership in helping our clients achieve compressed transformation, with 72 clients with bookings greater than $100 million compared to 53 last year and 229 diamond clients, our largest client relationships compared to 216 last year. With a 20% increase in bookings to $59 billion, we have strong momentum across all dimensions of our business across geographic markets, industries, and services. Reaching revenues of $50.5 billion, a significant milestone, representing 11% growth, we added $6.2 billion in revenue this year, gaining significant market share with 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, demonstrating, yet again, our ability to grow profitably and at scale. We achieved this profitable growth while investing at a higher level than ever before, with $4.2 billion in acquisitions; $1.1 billion in R&D in assets, platforms, and industry solutions, including growing our portfolio of patents and pending patents to more than 8,200; and total training investment of $900 million. And according to BrandZ, our brand value increased 56% to over $64 billion, ranking us number 27 on the prestigious BrandZ's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list. Finally, I want to highlight cloud and our ability to move with agility to serve our clients' needs and capture momentum in the market. At the beginning of FY'21, after investing in cloud for a decade, we saw that the pandemic would dramatically accelerate our clients' move to the cloud. More than technology, the move to the cloud would be about the adoption of a new operating system for future enterprise, a dynamic continuum of capabilities from public to edge to everything in between, opening up radically new ways for companies to work, compete, and drive value. Just over one year ago, we created Accenture Cloud First to capitalize on this momentum, bringing together all of our capabilities from migration to cloud-native development, data AI, industry talent, and change. Accenture Cloud First was the biggest driver of our overall cloud business growth from $12 billion to $18 billion, a 44% increase. KC, over to you.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes an outstanding year for Accenture and reflect broad-based momentum across all dimensions of our business. Once again, our results reflect our relentless focus to deliver across our three key imperatives for driving superior stakeholder value. So, let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenue growth of 21% in local currency, at the top end of our guided range, reflects double-digit growth across all markets, all industry groups, and all services. We also continue to extend our leadership position at an accelerated pace, with growth significantly above the market. Operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter, reflecting 40 basis points of expansion for the full-year. We delivered this expansion while investing significantly in our business and in our people to position us for long-term market leadership. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.20, which represents 29% growth, compared to adjusted EPS last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion, which was driven by continued strong growth and profitability. Now, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $15 billion for the quarter, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.2. We were very pleased with our new bookings, which represent 7% growth in U.S. dollars, with 18 clients with bookings over $100 million. We were also pleased with the strength of bookings across all services, with a book-to-bill of 1 in strategy and consulting, 1.2 in technology services, and 1.1 in operations. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $13.4 billion, a 24% increase in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currency, slightly above our FX-adjusted range as the FX tailwind was 3% compared to the 4% estimated last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 29% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.1 billion, up 19% in U.S. dollars, and 16% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, strategy and consulting, technology services, and operations, all grew very strong double digits. Turning to our geographic markets, in North America, revenue was 22% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, software and platforms, and public service. In Europe, revenues grew 18% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in consumer goods retail and travel services, industrial, and banking and capital markets. Looking closer at the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy. In growth markets, we delivered 21% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail, and travel services, banking and capital markets, and high-tech. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia, and Brazil. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.3%, compared with 31.8% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3%, compared with 10.6% for the fourth quarter, last year. General administrative expense was 7.4%, compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. Our operating income was $2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with Q4, last year. As a reminder, in Q4, last year, we recorded an investment gain that impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.29 for the quarter. The following comparisons exclude this impact, and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for the fourth quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.20 compared with adjusted EPS of $1.70 in the fourth quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 38 days compared to 36 days last quarter and 35 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion net of property and equipment additions of $236 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $8.2 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at August 31 last year with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $915 million at an average price of $305.61 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividends of $0.88 per share, for total of $558 million and our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on November 15, a 10% increase over last year and approved $3 billion of additional share repurchase authority. Now, I would like to take a moment to summarize our outstanding year. We're extremely pleased with the performance of our business in fiscal year '21, greatly exceeding all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last September, we delivered $59 billion in new bookings, a 20% increase in U.S. dollars over last year, which positions us well as we begin fiscal year '22. Revenues increased a record $6.2 billion, hitting the $50 billion mark, reflecting growth of 11% in local currency for the full-year. This result which is more than double the revenue growth we anticipated at the beginning of the year showcases our agility and ability to quickly scale to deliver value and outcomes for our clients. Operating margin of 15.1% reflected a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal year '20 above the top-end of our original guided range, even after making continued significant investments in our business and our people. Adjusted earnings per share were $8.80, reflecting 80% growth over adjusted FY'20 EPS and was well above our revenue growth. As a reminder, we adjusted earnings in both years to exclude gains on an investment. Free cash flow of $8.4 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.5 driven by strong profitability. And finally, we significantly exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $5.9 billion of cash to shareholders, while investing roughly $4.2 billion across 46 acquisitions to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic high growth areas of the market. So, again, FY'21 was truly an outstanding year. Momentum continues into fiscal '22 and we're laser focused on capturing the market opportunities, coupled with a disciplined execution that you and we expect of us. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, KC. Turning to the demand environment, compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital continues to drive strong double-digit growth across our business, including for Applied Intelligence, cloud, Industry X, Intelligent operations, Interactive, Intelligent platform services, security and transformational change management. Technology is the single biggest driver of change in companies today and the depth, breadth and scale of our technology capabilities across our services is unmatched. We see the demand environment shaping up for FY'22 to be more of the same while digital leaders seeking to widen their competitive advantage, and companies seeking to leapfrog their cloud and digital transformation are driving momentum in our business, the vast majority of companies are early in their transformation. And whether digital leader, leapfrogger, laggard or in between all face multi-year journeys ahead of them because the re-platforming in the cloud and use of new technologies across the enterprise is a once in a digital era profound transformation. Simultaneously, we have ongoing exponential technology change that is accelerating and will create new opportunities, disruptions and change for our clients. In addition, growth in parts of our business are by their very nature continuously evolving. For example, interactive, now a $12.5 billion business growing 15% continue to set a new standard for customer experience, connection, sales, and marketing at the intersection of data, creativity and technology, and is tied to the ever-changing needs and preferences of B2C and B2B customers. Similarly, security, now a $4.4 billion business growing 29% is driven by needs related to an ever expanding digital threat landscape. And with our managed services is providing much needed protection and talent to our clients. Our clients value the depth and breadth of our services for the entire enterprise across strategy and consulting, interactive technology and operations and industry and functional expertise across 13 industries. Plus the ability to deliver tangible outcomes as well as our strong track record of investing ahead of our clients to anticipate their needs and drive our next ways of growth such as our early moves in digital cloud and security. There remain entire parts of the enterprise. So, which digitization and the move to the cloud has only just begun. In particular, both the things companies make and the way they make things are being dramatically changed by technology. And that is the focus of our Industry X business, which we believe is the next big digital frontier. In fact, a 2021 Gartner survey, a Board of Directors indicates that 93% expect that the number one business priority that will see transformational improvement from digital technology is manufacturing, distribution, and supply chain. We have invested for nearly a decade in Industry X and are now at approximately $5 billion in revenue growing 36%. We look forward to welcoming the 4,200 industry leading engineers and consultants of Umlaut when the acquisition closes in October. Similarly, sustainability is a critical area for which technology is still evolving. We believe that every business must be a sustainable business, and yet companies are at very early stages of figuring out how to make this shift. Last year, building on years of investment and experience, we've launched our sustainability services under our new Chief Responsibility Officer and Global Sustainability Services Lead. We have continued to accelerate our focus in this expanding and changing market, and are proud of the work we are doing with leading partners like MasterCard, as we enhance its ability to track and analyze the carbon emissions of their suppliers and help de-carbonize the U.K. energy system with clients such as National Grid. We do see a shift in the nature of the demand for our managed services across IT, security and operations with these services emerging as one of our most strategic differentiators as companies simultaneously seek greater resilience, face a war for talent, the need to rapidly digitize and cost pressures, strategic managed services are increasingly a C-suite priority with Accenture as a trusted partner of choice, and increasingly integrated as part of their talent strategy. Table stakes from managed services are efficiency, resiliency, and reliability. We further differentiate in our managed services because they are uniquely informed by our strong strategy and consulting capabilities and deep industry and functional expertise. And they benefit from our strong level of investment for digital platforms like SynOps and myWizard and the seamless integration with our ecosystem partners, as well as due to the incredible pool of talented people our clients can access quickly when partnering with us. For example, we are partnering with Olympus, a leading manufacturer of optical and digital precision technology to help them drive their transformation to become a global medical technology company. As part of this partnership, we have acquired their Japanese IT subsidiary company, which we will transform to deliver significant IT cost savings to Olympus, as well as up-skill their people, combining their knowledge with our talent and technology to lead Olympus's digital transformation. And let me bring to life some more the demand we are seeing. All of these examples bring together the diverse capabilities across Accenture to create tangible value. We are a leader in cloud, because we're able to serve our clients across the cloud continuum and create business value. We are partnering with Kubota, a Japanese multi-national company, providing solutions leveraging a diverse range of products, technologies and services in the fields of food, water and the environment. To accelerate Kubota's digital transformation by creating solutions that will enhance the productivity and safety of food, promote circularity of water resources and waste and improve urban and living environments. We will help create innovative sustainability solutions and a platform applying leading edge digital technologies, including AI and IoT. Diverse data held across the group will be centralized for easy maintenance and use. We're also modernizing replacing our migrating legacy applications to the cloud and strengthening their global computer security incident response team. We are partnering with Jbal, a US-based global manufacturing services company to further enhance their IT infrastructure capabilities through providing infrastructure managed services for digital workplace, network, cloud and data center support. We're helping Senya a finish insurer offering casualty motor and health and accident services to implement a cloud-based policy administration system to improve customer service using data and automation to make sales, claims, payments and policy management processes more user friendly. This will allow the company to quickly respond to changing market and customer demands and meet its goal of providing the best customer experience in the industry. Compressed transformation is occurring across industries. We're partnering with Unilever, one of the world's largest consumer goods companies in their digital transformation. Together, we are setting a new industry standard by reinventing technology delivery with cutting edge automation, delivering cloud migration at scale, the largest ERP migration to the cloud and the industry and shifting to technology solutions that support their growth strategy. With McCormick a global leader in flavor in the food industry, where we're partnering on a strategic transformation program encompassing finance, supply chain logistics and plant maintenance. The new cloud-based platform an innovative data driven approach will help standardize processes, increase efficiencies, and support their goal of doubling in size quickly. We're helping a European financial institution, build the bank of the future and helping them become a next level innovator. One that is leveraging technology and sustainability to transform multiple parts of their business, drive hyper personalized customer experience, and create new lines of business like wealth management and insurance, which is expected to triple digital sales by 2023 and improve their already stellar cost to income ratio. At the same time, we're helping them deliver on their ESG initiatives, including inclusive financing, green software and carbon data free data centers. At Accenture, we're enabling new experience in growth and cost transformation across the enterprise and across industries. And a key enabler to these innovative scaled services is the power of our operations capabilities. We are helping Open Fiber an Italian telecommunications company design and orchestrate construction of an ultra-broadband network, which will deliver fiber to 20 million households across Italy. Digitization and automation will help the construction site to proceed faster and more efficiently. With Interactive, we're helping MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Europe's leading consumer electronics retailer transform their digital content capabilities with a state of the art marketing operations. Automation and data insights enabled by synapse will help deliver more engaging and personalized content, while driving millions and savings. Our industry expertise continues to be a core competitive advantage, allowing us to breathe deep industry and cross industry knowledge enterprise wide for our clients. I want to recognize in particular, our software and platform industry, which is approximately $4 billion in revenue. In Q4 this group celebrated 20 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, serving as a leading partner to our clients in this hyper growth industry. KC, back to you.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 0.5%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21, and reflects an estimated 18% to 22% growth of currency. For the full fiscal year '22, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results, in U.S. dollars, will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 12% to 15% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 5% as we continue to expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. For earnings per share, we expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.18 or 13% to 16% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. For the full fiscal '22, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we expect to return at last $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie.\nAngie Park: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you please provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] And today, let’s see our first question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, many thanks for letting me the opportunity to ask a question. I had two, if I could. Outstanding set of results and guidance, first of all. I wanted to ask about the cash flow, if I could, guidance. And even at the high end of the range, the cash flow margin would be a pretty significant step down from fiscal '20 and fiscal '21. So, I just wondered, is there any puts and takes within the cash flow guidance that we should be aware of as we're doing our model? Thank you. And I have a quick follow-up to that.\nKC McClure: Sure, it's great, thanks. Nice to hear from you, Keith. Yes, so our free cash flow of $7.5 billion to $8 billion, it reflects very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. And so, we're really pleased with that. And it does have slightly higher CapEx expense of $700 million. So, that's one slight difference from over '21. We did have exceptionally strong free cash flow in fiscal year '21 at 1.5 free cash flow to net income ratio, and that is just exceptional performance. It's not unusual for us to have free cash flow guidance at the beginning of the year, that is a decrease over what we've done in the previous years. And then lastly, we do allow for a slight uptick in DSO in our guidance for next year, which would still be very industry-leading DSO performance.\nKeith Bachman: Okay, excellent. And then Julie, maybe just for you, I think you mentioned, this year, you did 46 M&A deals. And you mentioned in the guidance comments that there's quite a bit of M&A, I think, $4 billion in M&A contemplated for this coming fiscal year. How do you think about the integration risk? Accenture has, I would argue, a very special culture. And you're brining in a lot of new people over the course of the last 12 months, and the forward next 12 months. How do you think about the risk of assimilation of these deals? And how do you manage this process? You have a very good track record over the last 10 years, but there is a lot of M&A on the table that you're bringing in the company. I’m just wondering if you could speak to how you think about the risk associated with that to make sure the business keeps moving forward?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. So great question, and thanks, Keith. So, first of all, as you indicated, we've got a really strong track record. And so, this step up in acquisition comes based on years of experience, including and fine-tuning integration, so that's number one. Secondly, our acquisitions happen globally. And then as I've talked about this year, they're pretty evenly balanced. And why it is that important? When we switched to our model earlier this year of a geographic-focused model from a P&L perspective, one of the reasons is to allow us as well to be super close to our people. And most of these acquisitions are not global, right? Some are like an umlaut, but like for example, Project Novetta, in the federal business, very local. And the vast majority are in one or two markets. Like there -- and so, the integration, it's not like you have this enormous company that's trying to integrate lots of people all over the globe at the same time. We have senior leaders accountable for the acquisitions. And so, we really get the right balance. And we have our own -- and so, for example, when we look at this, we look at market-by-market how many acquisitions are we doing in this market, so how does that enable us to make sure that we can spend the time? So, this is a finely tuned approach for integration. And of course, we bring on people in acquisition or not all the time. And so, this focus on culture is just part of who we are.\nKeith Bachman: Okay, excellent. Thank you, Julie.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thinking about the $50 billion revenue milestone, which is pretty amazing. Julie, as you're mapping out the path to $60 billion over the next few years, can you talk about where you see the major sources of incremental revenue looking out from here forward? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Great. Well, thanks, Lisa, nice to talk to you. So, first of all, and I talked a little bit about this in the script. We are still very early in the transformation of companies in building just their digital core. So, for example, if you look at something like SAP, their stats that they could point out, you sort of have less than 20% of companies who've actually both bought and begun implementing S/4HANA, right? And we see the move to the cloud. You've got sort of maybe today, roughly 25% to 30% of workload. So, there's a lot of work, which is a multiyear journey in actually building the digital core, and then at the same time transforming the way they work. And there -- so, we've got multiyear ahead. And even when you look at who is doing compressed transformation, you have this core of leaders and leapfrogger. But the vast majority of companies are not yet engaged in compressed transformation. So, just from a multiyear outlook on the fundamentals of re-platforminig and moving to a true digital-enabled enterprise is still in early stages. Then you add on top of that, there are whole parts of the enterprise where even the technologies are really new. And so Industry X is a great example of that. We see that as the next digital frontier, and we're still very, very early. And so, that will be kind of its own wave as we look forward. And then areas like sustainability, again, technology is early. Every industry has to find its way on sustainability. And so, as we think about our own growth strategy, it starts with what our clients need. So, we continue to diversify the parts of the enterprise that we're serving. And that enables -- that's what our clients need, and that enables the next wave of growth for us. And we continue to innovate and anticipate, like in sustainability, what our clients need. And so, when you kind of take his, you see, both from serving the enterprise, the maturity of that. And then on add on top of that that there are areas that are evergreen, like interactive, it's all about client, the growth agenda, it's always going to change. Manufacturing will be the same. Security grows as the digital landscape grows. So, hopefully, that gives you a flavor of how we're thinking about, both our next ways of growth and just the resiliency of the diversity of what we do.\nLisa Ellis: Yes, terrific. My follow-up was actually on managed services, which you called out in the prepared remarks. Not really used to thinking about Accenture doing managed services. Can you just elaborate a bit on that? Is this primarily actually infrastructure-related managed services or apps or just maybe a little bit more detail on what exactly you're doing in Accenture's differentiation there? Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: So just think if we have consulting and outsourcing, right, so managed services is just another term for outsourcing. And so, if you think about our operations business, which is now about $8 billion, right? So, all the managed services we provide, everything from finance and accounting to industry specific, like we called out in the script, the stuff we're doing in telecom, we're doing things in insurance, in both health and P&C, so we have industry specific, we have marketing services through that. Then of course, there's our powerful IT services, we've been doing outsourcing for years, right, term application outsourcing is an industry term. And then, we have our managed services and security, we bought Symantec last year. And so, this is a core part when you think about our revenue between consulting and outsourcing. And the point that's happening now is that we've already done this, but what we're seeing is, I just had a call with the CEO the other day, who's like he started a call with like, Julie, I'm really having a hard time hiring people in digital, right? And how are you seeing companies help and we talked about how, by strategically outsourcing like in security, in marketing, you can access the digital talent, and it becomes part of their own talent strategy to address the work for talent, while at the same time, digitizing faster, I have another client who said look, you had 50 things that my IT department was about to build in order for us to automate and transform and I get it through your SynOps platform, the same as to on the IT and infrastructure side. And, of course, infrastructure managed services in the cloud growing area as well from the move to the cloud. So, I think the shift we were calling out is just how strategic this is, at a time of compress transformation, because it's meeting the needs of the war on talent, and the need to digitize and the need to move fast at the same time.\nLisa Ellis: Great, thank you. Thanks a lot and congrats.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. First, got a question on bookings, can you talk about the dynamic in 4Q, it looks like outsourcing did tick down for the first time in a while year-over-year. So, just anything to call up there, and then just generally, how do you see the pipeline developing as you think about fiscal '22 bookings levels?\nKC McClure: Yes, thanks, Bryan. So, there's nothing really to point out in terms of Q4 bookings with outsourcing, they can just be a little bit lumpy. But it was very strong performance. But let me just maybe talk a little bit about overall bookings as we head into '22, we do feel really good about the momentum in our business. And as Julie went through, we had 72 clients with bookings over $100 million this year. And you can see that then helping us as we head into FY'22, Bryan with 18% to 22% that we have in Q1. And you also see that in our 12% to 15% revenue range that we have for fiscal '22. I think it's important to also note that, it does include about 5% in organic contribution, but it's at the top end of our revenue range, again driven by bookings, it's going to represent about 10% organic growth at the upper end. And while we do benefit from an easier compare in the first-half, it does continue to imply strong organic growth in the second-half. And if you look at why is that, when you peel back bookings, again pleased with the $15 billion that we had in Q4, strong book-to-bill is 1.1, it is $60 billion for the whole year with double-digit growth in consulting. And I think it's important also net consulting bookings, we had $8 billion for the last three quarters, which is terrific. In outsourcing, which for the entire year have had a very strong book-to-bill of 1.2 in all three markets and services. And when you peel it back, there's really three things again, just peeling back bookings for you, there's three things that I would also note, one is that yes, we did have a lot of larger bookings that help us for -- position us well for the future throughout FY'22, but we had a nice mix all the way through to the smaller deals which benefit near-term revenue. The second thing is that the bookings were very broad-based across all of our services, and that includes strategy and consulting, which is really good as well. And lastly, they're aligned as Julie talked quite a bit about our strategic priorities cloud, Industry X and security for example.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you. A follow-up here then on attrition, can you just give us a sense of what you're anticipating for attrition levels backward into '22, and any added measures you're taking to try and drive that 19% down?\nKC McClure: Yes. So, let me just maybe talk a little bit about the numbers, and Julie can give some other color here, but our managed attrition 90% Bryan was really the fourth quarter was in the zone that we expected. And it's 14% for the year, and we've been at 19% before. It's obviously a very hot market right now, but when you peel it back, it continues to be more in the lower part of the pyramid, and it's largely concentrated in India where we really don't have any issues in hiring.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And I think that's important because you look at a headline number, and then you'd have to really kind of understand whereas the attrition, and at the same time, as you might imagine, we're always very focused on making sure that we're attractive. So, we're very pleased at our executive retention is going very well. I think we are very much focused on our employee value proposition. And when you think about the actions you've taken like a record number of 120,000 promotions, the training that we're providing people that's really valued. And then, frankly, things like the way that we have approached vaccines, right? So we've now vaccinated 85,000 of our people in their families directly in addition to what we're supporting through like in the U.S. through our carriers. And as I talked a little bit about in the script, what we find is people really care about the fact that they are working for a company that focuses on financials and all of the other -- what we call 360 degree values. So, what we're doing in sustainability, being a leader that we're going to be carbon emission by 2025 really matters. And so, we continue to look at how can we help our people be net better off succeed personally and professionally, and be proud of a company that not only creates value, but leads with values.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. Wanted to ask a couple of quick questions that are follow up on the hiring your pace of hiring and net has been quite stunning, at least over the last couple of quarters. Can you talk about a little more detail in terms of how you're finding the hiring environment, particularly for newer skill sets, and I guess, do you think you need to kind of sustain the recent pace of hiring going forward? And I guess my second question, I'll just throw it in at the same time as back to V&A, you talked about kind of the inorganic contribution and integration, but is this kind of the recent pace that we've seen? Is this also something that you expect to need to sustain and want to sustain on a go-forward basis on whether in terms of number of deals or amount that you're spending, et cetera? Thanks a lot.\nJulie Sweet: Okay. Thanks. I will cover the head count. So, I would just first start with in this market with a war for talent, we're very pleased with the 56,000 net additional people that we hired in Q4, as we see strong momentum, really continuing in FY'22, and you see that again in our growth rates for the first quarter, we're off to a strong start at 18% to 22% in Q1, and the full-year at the top end at 15%. And we were able to accelerate some of our hiring, and we plan to continue to do so in quarter one, in order to have the talented people that we need to match demand in the market. And so, that's to your first question on hiring. To your second question on V&A, I won't guide longer term, and to the amount of spend that we're going to do past '22 in V&A. It remains an important part of our strategy on a go-forward basis.\nKC McClure: Yes. And I think it's just to remember taking a step back, on two things. One is on the people side, we made a deliberate decision to accelerate hiring this quarter and next quarter, which given as you said, the environment and our ability to attract people we think makes sense so that we're not -- we're not worried about being constrained with respect to people. And we're able to do that. And I think that's a huge differentiator for us. And secondly, and we made a decision last year, and we've made a decision this year in V&A to really invest and take advantage of our ability to invest to serve our clients. And when I got clients, one of the things that we talk about is, and clients really value is that when they're partnering with us, they're partnering not just for the capabilities we have today, but because we have a track record of investing year in and year out and creating and anticipating their needs. And we point to the kinds of acquisitions like in Umlaut, like in Nevada, like Infinity Works in cloud, that we're doing it in markets all around the world to benefit them. And so, we believe this is really setting us up last year and this year, right for this next ways of growth. And it's truly differentiating in the eyes of our clients.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Julie. Hi, KC, Angie, congratulations on the results and outlook. First question is, it seems clear, we're in a very exciting time here for IT services. I've had this view for some time now that the acceleration of demand that you're seeing is sustainable for several years. And I don't mean to imply that getting revenue growth is easy. But if you have to worry less about revenue growth, given the investments you've already made. Do you have the opportunity to change your financial model as accelerated to get higher gross margins, better G&A leverage? Thoughts on moving to a more non-linear model with solutions may be especially important given the 620,000 people?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, I'll start with that. I think, Ashwin, our financial model really remains the same in terms of three key imperatives that we have to go through each year, which is grow faster than the market take share, modest margin expansion while investing at scale and our business and our people. So, in the last part, maybe just talk about op margin. So, we are very proud of the 10% to 30%, that we have this year. That does imply obviously, that we will continue to get efficiencies in how we run our business, both in terms of how we deliver to our clients, as well as within the SG&A and how we run our own organization.\nKC McClure: Yes, maybe just set a couple of points. I'm glad to acknowledge that revenue growth is not easy. So, thank you for that. But we're just taking a step back to just to make sure, because I think over the last decade you've seen a real shift in the professional services industry. The nature of the exponential technology change and the need to help clients move faster, and do so more efficiently has meant that you need to be able to invest significantly. So, as we think about moving forward, like the investments we've done to build, SynOps like to and continue to evolve it to build industry solutions as you mentioned, require us to continuously innovate, invest. You saw that in our IP patent portfolio. And so, what I would say is, it's not that you sort of say, here's the revenue, and then can you just fundamentally ship because there is significant cost. Having all aspects of our business grow like this is not simply, because there's demand. It's the solutions we're bringing them. And as I've talked about in prior earnings call, it isn't linear today even, because we've automated so much of what we do when you look at something like our operations business, you look at my wizard, and we continue to do so. And that's really part of the business now. And so, I think it's important to kind of understand what's helping drive the demand for our services. The way we're gaining market share is not simply because there's a lot of demand in the market, but the solutions we're bringing. And this is our big differentiator, because we can go all the way from strategy to operations right? All of the examples we're giving involve multiple assets or services and you can't just build that overnight either, right? So, the fact that we're becoming integrated in talent strategy in our outsourcing and we also call managed services is about being trusted. And the fact that we could deliver during the pandemic and be a trusted partner puts us in a very different place than others who might be trying to build these capabilities.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it, got it. Thank you for that. And then the other question is over the last 18 months, your revenue growth has absorbed the negative impact of less P&E. Is that coming back, do you have updated thoughts on back to office, what's the assumption for that in your outlook?\nJulie Sweet: So, I'll let KC answer specifically, but I will say that if any of us can actually predict, how we're going to go to the office, I'd like to meet that person. It is good to say, it's been a humbling experience, right? How many times have we all gotten ready to go back and I don't know about you, but like five different things that we're going to be in person the next two months, I've just turned back to Zoom or Teams. So, it's been an interesting time the new normal but KC, why don't you take us through just to see assumptions we're using?\nKC McClure: Yes, so Ashwin, just I'll first start with revenue, our revenue guidance the 12 to 15, it does not include any specific up tick from reimbursable travel, and if that assumption changes will reflect that in our updated guidance. And as Julie said, just in terms of increases to travel assumed in our overall P&L for '22, it is difficult to predict, but we do have an increased build into particularly in the back half of the year for some travel costs.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you for that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I wanted to start just with the visibility question. The reason I asked is obviously your cost of currency revenue growth here in Q4 was quite robust. So, it wasn't really above the top end of your guidance, whereas in recent quarters, you had been handily exceeding the top end of your expectation. So, I'm just wondering, is this simply because your visibility has improved, so you've gotten more comfortable, you don't necessarily need to put extra cushion into the guidance or did some bookings not ramp as fast as expected in the quarter and then just a related question for fiscal '22 as you set the initial outlook for this year, any change in approach versus this time last year again perhaps because your visibility has improved? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yes, I will answer both questions in really the same way, which is for the fourth quarter, we were slightly above our FX adjusted guided range, but we always try to aim to be in the top quadrant, top part of our guided range. And really just this year, it's been a story of an unprecedented ramp. So, we're really pleased that we were able to kind of nail down where we thought we would end up the quarter. And it's the same thing really for '22, it's not any change in visibility, it's not any change in the way we're doing things. We always call it as we see it, these are our best estimates. And with the 12 and 15 all parts, all points are in possibility. That's why they're in the range, but we continue like we always do to aim for the top quadrant in top part of the range, no change.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Okay, good to know. And just a follow-up, what are your expectations for book-to-bill, in consulting and overall for the first quarter and for the full fiscal year? And then just what you're thinking about for consulting versus outsourcing revenue growth this year? Thanks, guys. Congrats.\nKC McClure: Yes, thank you. Yes, so we feel good about our pipeline as we head into the fiscal year, I would say, I will just comment on Q1 bookings, we do feel really good about where we are, historically, we do see some seasonality in Q1 and large deals can make things lumpy, but we feel really good about our positioning for the first quarter. And in terms of revenue growth, I'll just say that for quarter one, we see consulting continuing in strong double-digits and outsourcing in the double-digit range.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, got it.\nAngie Park: Great, operator, we have time.\nKC McClure: Yes, for the full-year, I mean consulting should continue to be strong double-digits and outsourcing depending on where we landed, the range will be high single to low double-digits.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you.\nAngie Park: Great, thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Of course, and that last question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thank you so much. Really impressive growth at scale here, I wanted to ask on Industry X, it was $5 billion in revenues, so it's up 36% I wrote down, so I think Julie said it's the next frontier here. Does this have potential to be as big as cloud? I'm just trying to think about the sizing of Industry X recognizing it's early, but also its importance?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, I mean I think we're not really sizing that today. I mean, if we think about cloud as the entire enterprise, so sort of hard to sort of do that. What we'd say is, this will be I mean, we're already at $5 billion and we consider it the next digital frontier and it's super early, right, some technologies have just really been coming online in the last year or two that are cloud based. And when you look at like what we're doing for example, like Vivienne Westwood, one of the largest independent global fashion companies, we're doing a new PLM solution for them. We're doing so for Ahlstrom, Ahlstrom a ultimate global leader in transportation where you doing the same in a power company so that the range of what we're doing I mean is both broad based in terms of industry. And so, we do think of this as really a big growth driver for the future, but not sizing it today.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay, no worries. Just thought it was interesting, because the scope of it can be quite large. Just my quick follow-up, I know you had you feel a lot of questions on acquisitions, already. Digital assets are being valued pretty highly here across the board. Looks like you're still implying a reasonable revenue multiple with your inorganic contribution, have you seen any changes on the valuation side? I know, you're still a destination for many companies, but just curious the valuations have changed in any way you're thinking?\nJulie Sweet: KC, do you want to answer that?\nKC McClure: You know, clearly, valuations, we participate in the overall market, you've seen what valuations have done in the overall market, but I would just say that, we have pretty high hurdle rates in terms of what we expect from our business cases. And we track that very closely, as you would expect of us. And we're very pleased with our ongoing performance of our portfolio against the hurdle rates that we put forth in this business cases.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes, it's impressive. Thank you both.\nKC McClure: Okay, thank you.\nJulie Sweet: All right, well now it's time to wrap up. In closing, I want to thank all of our people and our Managing Directors for what you all do every day, our people at actions and results in FY'21 has really put us in a terrific position as we go into FY'22 to create even more value ahead. And I know I and the entire leadership team are super excited and confident about what's to come. And I'll simply end by thanking all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. Be well everyone. Thanks.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for replay after 10 A.M. Eastern today through December 16.

Welcome to the Accenture First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Angie Park, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAngie Park: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I am Angie Park, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results; KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning, before KC provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we will discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Angie, and thank you everyone for joining us. I would like to start by thanking our 674,000 people around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients. Our results again, this quarter reflect how you are living our purpose every day to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. As more and more companies embrace compressed transformation, our clients are turning to us as their trusted partner, as reflected in our outstanding growth of 27% this quarter. We added 15 new diamond clients bringing the total to 244. Diamond clients are our largest relationships. And to give some context, we added 13 diamonds in all of FY '21. We also had record bookings of $16.8 billion, 30% growth year-over-year with 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. And we expanded operating margin 20 basis points in Q1 with adjusted EPS growth of 28%. While we continue to invest in our business and people, including $1.7 billion in acquisitions, and in just the first quarter, we invested $250 million in learning for our people, with 8.6 million training hours for approximately 14 hours per person. The extraordinary demand we see in the market reflects the imperative of digital transformation. Companies are making critical decisions about who will be their strategic partners. And they are selecting us because of our talented people, our deep industry and technology capabilities, and our commitment to both create value and lead with value. We predicted back in 2013 that every business would be a digital business. And we have executed a clear strategy to rotate our business to anticipate and be ready to serve our clients. And when the pandemic hit, we were ready with capabilities that scale reflected in 70% of our revenue at that time being from digital cloud and security, with strong relationships with the world's leading technology companies, which in some cases go back decades, with a focus on growing our people through learning, allowing us to rapidly re-skill, with an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity and equality and caring for our people professionally and personally, making us a talent magnet in a tight labor market, adding 50,000 talented individuals in Q1. And it is our breadth of capabilities across strategy and consulting interactive technology and operations, which is unique in our industry that allows us to work side by side with our clients to deliver results. And we believe our goal to create 360 degree value for our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities is an essential part of our success. Certainly our commitment to creating vibrant career paths for our people is an important part of this value and we just completed our annual promotion process. I want to congratulate our 1,030 new promotes to Managing Director, 143 new appointments to Senior Managing Directors and the more than 90,000 people we promoted around the world in Q1 overall. Today we launched our 360 value reporting experience, a new way to show our progress and the value we create in all directions for all of our stakeholders. More on that later. KC, over to you.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. Happy Holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations, setting a new bookings records at $16.8 billion, with consulting bookings exceeding the previous record by more than $1 billion. Our results reflected strong double-digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business, all markets, services and industry groups. And we saw improved pricing in many parts of our business. Based on the strength of our first quarter results and the demand we see in the market, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and EPS outlook. Now let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenues grew 27% in local currency, increasing more than $3.2 billion over Q1 last year, and more than $600 million above our guided range, with broad based over delivery across all markets, services and industries with all 13 industry groups growing double digits. We continue to extend our leadership position with growth we estimate to be more than 5x the market which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin of 16.3% for the quarter, an increase -- with an increase of 20 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people, in our business, including acquisitions. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.78, up 28% over adjusted fiscal '21 results. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $349 million and return $1.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested approximately $1.7 billion in acquisitions, and we continue to expect to invest approximately $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. With those high level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were record at $16.8 billion for the quarter, representing 30% growth in U.S dollars, and were $800 million higher than our previous record. With an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were record at $9.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our bookings this quarter, which reflected 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. All of our service dimensions, strategy consulting, technology services and operations, as well as our geographic markets delivered strong double-digit bookings growth in U.S dollars. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15 billion, a 27% increase in U.S dollars and in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, up 33% in U.S dollars and 32% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.6 billion, up 21% U.S dollars and in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimension, strategy and consulting, technology services and operations all grew very strong double-digit. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 26% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in public service, software and platforms, and consumer goods, retail and travel services. In Europe, revenues grew 28% local currency, led by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, industrial and banking and capital markets. Looking closer to countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, U.K., France and Italy. In growth markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, banking and capital markets and public service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, compared with 33.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.7% compared with 10.4% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were 6.9% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.4 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.3% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with Q1 last year. Before I continue, as a reminder, we recognized an investment gain in Q1 last year, which impacted our tax rates and increased EPS by $0.15. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.7% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.78 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 42 days, compared to 38 days last quarter and 38 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $349 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $531 million, net of property and equipment additions of $182 million. Our cash balance at November 30 was $5.6 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.4 million shares for $845 million at an average price of $346.19 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $5.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $613 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on February 15, a 10% increase over last year. So in summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results and we are off to a very strong start in FY '22. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. Starting with the demand environment, as we expected across industries and the globe, technology continues to be the single biggest driver of change, accelerating, disrupting and creating new opportunities. More companies are embracing compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital and are moving to build their digital core and use technology to transform how they operate and to find new ways to compete and grow as you would expect for 27% revenue growth. We are seeing broad based demand across all markets, services and industries with double-digit growth across all our strategic growth priorities, including Applied Intelligence, Cloud, Industry X, Interactive, Intelligent Operations, Intelligent Platform Services, Security and Transformational Change Management. Let me bring this demand to life. First, compressed transformation is occurring across the globe and the key enabler is the cloud across the continuum from public to hybrid to increasingly the edge, and the move to leading SaaS platforms along with the convergence of cloud and data. For example, we are working with a leading global supplier of tires and mobility solutions to migrate to the cloud, modernize its IT platforms, use data to accelerate growth and value and shift to a digital supply chain. We created a state-of-the-art system to track inventory, sales, warranty information and returns, all in the cloud, all in real time and have already helped to increase customer satisfaction 35% with improved cost optimization and increased revenue up next. We're also helping Mount Sinai Health System, New York City's largest academic medical system transform, modernize and increase its resilience by migrating its clinical systems, non-clinical systems and clinical data to a stable, secure cloud based infrastructure to proactively detect and prevent threats, adapt to business and regulatory changes, together with a potential to save millions over the next 5 years, savings that can be reinvested to fund strategic innovative programs and help rescale teams. Our deep industry expertise is helping companies find new solutions and path to growth and helping their customers. For example, we are collaborating with Opay, a leading Finnish Financial Group to use automation, advanced analytics and other emerging technologies to increase business agility, reduce cost, and deliver enhanced customer and employee experiences. Opay will adopt the Intelligent Automation Platform, Accenture myWizard to enable the company to extract greater value from its technology investments. We are working with TUGA, a leading utilities provider in Germany to create and operate a game changing meter-to-cash IT platform in the cloud. It will help reduce operating costs by up to 40%, accelerate time to market and free up resources for energy transition and innovations like smart metering, helping customers make environmentally conscious decisions and energy providers stay responsive and reliable. And as we talked about last quarter, our Sustainability Services are focused on helping our clients across industries move from commitment to action at scale. We see these services is critical to our clients agendas. I'm pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement to acquire Zestgroup, a Dutch sustainability services company with 140 employees that specializes in energy transition services and sourcing renewables and other clean energy sources. We look forward to welcoming them and working together to help clients move at speed to achieve net zero carbon. We continue to help our clients to enter the next digital frontier of Industry X. We're excited to have completed the acquisition of umlaut and are seeing the power of our combination already. Together we're working with a global technology leader to transform from a traditional engineering platform to a more agile model based engineering platform that uses simulation and analysis from design and development all the way through the product lifecycle. We were also working with an American wireless operator to help improve daily operations and transform their network security by combining our deep security risk assessment and communications industry skills. Of course, growth is at the heart of every client's agenda and Interactive is helping our clients capture new growth with their customers with our unique combination of creativity, technology, data, AI and industry expertise. For example, we are applying our digital global capabilities to help Capri Holdings Limited, a global fashion luxury group consisting of the iconic brands Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, translate its rich in-store luxury shopping experience to a digital experience that aligns with shifting customer behaviors and accelerate sustainable growth. As a strategic partner with Volkswagen Group, a German motor vehicle manufacturer, we're helping Audi and VW to pave the way for sustainable growth through precise continuous commerce and rich experiences along the entire car buying journey. We are combining the power of AI of predictive analytics to deliver the right experiences at the right time to accelerate revenue growth through an expanded digital commerce ecosystem. We're also working with VLI, a Brazilian logistics solutions company and Trato [ph] its new platform business to provide a digital one stop shop for self employed truckers to enhance their growth, to improve logistics by offering options for more profitable freight products as well as to provide them access to critical services such as insurance, loans and health care, all by combining data [ph] analytics and AI. We see an increasing demand to create the platforms that power the digital products and experiences our clients seek for their customers. We're helping CLO, a leader in electronic payments in Latin America become more competitive by migrating to the cloud, which will accelerate new product development and enables cutting edge technologies. This will make it easier to launch innovative products, reduce time to market by two-thirds and lower costs, all while enhancing their customers experience. And of course security is critical to all our clients. We were proud to be selected by the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA in the U.S., America's risk advisor defending against today's threats, with advanced cyber services to help the Department of Homeland Security protect federal, civilian and executive branch systems against cyber attacks like ransomware, botnets and malware campaigns. Even as companies undergo compressed transformation, exponential technology changes continue. We are investing to anticipate the future and we are working with our clients to innovate and take advantage of emerging technologies to compete and win. Our R&D is powered by Accenture Labs and Ventures and extends across every part of our business so that we can quickly translate research into real results for our clients. For example, we are working with ESPN to explore how emerging technologies can enable new ways for fans to experience sports at the ESPN edge innovation center, leveraging the years of early investments we've made in extended reality. We've been a key participant in shaping the innovation in enterprise, blockchain technologies across the globe, with applications in financial markets, supply chain and digital identity, which now are creating value for our clients. From partnering with the Digital Dollar Foundation to explore a U.S central bank digital currency to working with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited to build a new integrated settlement platform using digital asset modeling language, Smart Contract. And while the metaverse has recently burst into the public eye, we've been an early innovator in applying the technology. In fact, we often innovate on cutting edge technologies by deploying them at Accenture first. We are proud to have the largest enterprise metaverse to what we call the Nth Floor and are deploying over 60,000 virtual reality headsets and have created one Accenture Park, a virtual campus for onboarding and immersive learning, including meeting rooms and collaborative experiences. Our VR environments provide our people with a human connection and learning experiences in an immersive digital world. We are also working with clients to help explore and shape their early forays into the metaverse through new digital experiences enabled by virtual reality and responding to their interests in new products enabled by NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, new ways to conduct commerce as the metaverse takes shape. Many of these client examples reflect our goal to create 360 degree value. This goal reflects our growth strategy, our purpose, our core values and our culture of shared success. It is also how we operate Accenture and we measure our success by how well we are achieving this goal for all our stakeholders. And today, we are proud to present our new 360 degree value reporting experience, a new way to share our progress, which is available on our website. With this comprehensive digital tool, you'll find all our reporting and data in one place, measuring how we're doing. We've expanded our ESG reporting with three additional ESG framework, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, SASB, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, TCFD and the World Economic Forum International Business Council WEF, IBC metrics, while continuing to report against the Global Reporting Initiative GRI standards, the UNGC 10 principles and the Carbon Disclosure Project, CDP because we believe that transparency builds trust and helps us all make more progress. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 4% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 22% to 26% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '22, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on a result in U.S dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 19% to 22% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which continued to assume an inorganic contribution of 5%. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. For earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $10.32 to $10.60 or 17% to 20% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $8.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up, so we can take your questions. Angie? Angie Park Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask the question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thank you so much. Yes, really remarkable growth here in [technical difficulty] $600 million. I think that's the largest number of growth [technical difficulty] got to ask what surprise you [technical difficulty] with the compressed transformation and [technical difficulty] more on …\nJulie Sweet: Hi, I think we were -- Tien-tsin, we are having a little trouble hearing you, but I think I got it. You want to know what drove our over delivery -- are the over delivery $600 million?\nTien-tsin Huang: You got it.\nKC McClure: Okay, that's what I thought. So first of all, good morning to you. So the first thing I would say is that overall in terms of our revenue production this quarter, everyone did better. It really was broad based over delivery across all of our markets, all of our industries and our services. And when you want to -- when you peel that back, you really start with bookings. So we have broad based over delivery also in our bookings. And so you see that flowing through our revenue production, Tien-tsin. And on that bookings production, well, we had 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. It really was broad based growth in our bookings, across, the larger deals all the way down to midsize and smaller deals. And then so that also really did help us drive more revenue. And importantly, we were able to meet this demand, because we have the people able here to work on the extra demand coming from the bookings. So we were really very pleased with the overall broad base delivery in the first quarter. And that is why we see that coming into the second quarter, and then a big part, obviously, of our full year revenue increase.\nTien-tsin Huang: Got it. Thanks [technical difficulty] hope you can hear me okay. My follow-up just maybe for Julie [technical difficulty] 360 degree in [technical difficulty] been hearing a lot about that here. [Technical difficulty] becomes a bigger factor [technical difficulty]. Is that part of the [technical difficulty] care of pushing this [technical difficulty] 360 degree?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, no, it's a great question, Tien-tsin. And I think there's a couple of things that are going on. So first of all, we absolutely see in more of the requests for proposals, our clients asking to understand your position on sustainability, for example. So we’re -- we've been -- and we've seen that trend for at least the last 12 months that it's more important formally in our RFPs. But we also see it in the conversations we're having with clients, that they are asking a lot about this, they're very much focused. And so when we talk about it, it's important to them. And so, when we launch this strategy around 360 degree value over a year ago now, it was based on the conversations we were already having with clients, right. We launched it, because our clients were saying, we have to achieve this. And the biggest issues, I think in the world that we look for is how do you move from commitment to action. And so there's -- and part of that is, therefore clients also want to partner with companies that are equally committed, and it matters to them things like 50% of our centers around the world are using renewable energy, right? It matters to them, the work that we're doing on IT -- green IT software, so that eventually we'll be able to have much more sustainable software development. So it's definitely a buyer value. We see it formally. We see it informally. And we see it in terms of what they're trying to do, which is why our sustainability services are also so important, and you heard some of the examples today.\nTien-tsin Huang: That's excellent. Thank you, guys.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nKC McClure: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. So you often talk about the market share gains. I'm curious if you've seen an inflection in win rates over the last few quarters, or has there been a significant uptick in overall demand in the market with consistent win rates that is driving this level of growth?\nJulie Sweet: Good morning, Bryan. It's the latter. So let me just start with -- we've seen a really consistent win rate. But maybe I'll peel back to what we talked about in the fourth quarter. When we were coming into the year, we felt really good about our pipeline. Even in a seasonably lower quarter, we thought -- we saw good bookings for the first quarter. And obviously, you saw that come through. And our bookings are record bookings this quarter. But I will say even with that, we feel really good about our pipeline, even after the record bookings and that's the statement across all markets and services.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then my follow-up, so when we think about headcount progression, it would seem you're on a path to hit a million people here over the next 3 years or so. So as you've gotten larger, can you talk about what you've had to do differently to enable the strong execution across so many global resources. And just how are you thinking about what you were going to need to do more of as you get even larger?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. That's a great question, Bryan. Let me take that. And I think there's three things to focus on. One is how we manage the business. So just to take you back to March 1, 2020 when we announced our next gen growth model, one of the explicit reasons we reorganized at the time, focused on geographies we said was to enable us to scale. And so that's enabled us because we're still fundamentally a people business. It's also driven by a lot of assets, but you need to be able to be close to clients and people. And so that change really allowed us to be where we are now, where we're scaling. But it also, in addition to the scaling, it helps us be more agile. Like you'll remember, we put that into place and we created Accenture Cloud first 4 months later, right, which has been a huge success. And it's the agility by simplifying our structure at the same time. So first, it's -- how we manage our business in terms of an organizational perspective, and having simplified our business. The second piece is the focus on employee experience. Our -- one of our eight leadership essentials is caring for our people, personally and professionally. And this is a very important part of how we are able to scale and drive our culture. And you'll see in our attrition, it again is at the lower end of the pyramid in India, and we have significantly lower attrition at the executive and above. And that is very much we believe, because of how we focus on our people. And the last piece, which is our culture. You notice that we talked about the metaverse and what we've launched in our script today. That's another way of how we're driving our culture. We are constantly innovative -- innovating. So in a world where people can have as many physical experiences today, we created this immersive experience, which connects people, right, which builds connections. And so the focus on being smart about how we manage our people and staying close to them and our clients, our leadership and how we promote and develop and then constantly innovating to build the connection and the culture. We call it omni connections are absolutely critical when you're scaling.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Okay.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of macro questions from me. Can you talk about how inflation is affecting your business? Specifically, is it a tailwind to revenues? Because you're seeing -- you're able to pass through labor cost inflation on to clients? And if so, are there other factors as well that you might call out on inflation? Thank you.\nKC McClure: Yes, maybe I'll start and then Julie, if there's -- you can add in, in terms of what we're seeing with our clients. But maybe, Lisa -- maybe we'll start with inflation, and I'll take it from maybe from a wage increase perspective. So, to state the obvious wage inflation is on all our minds, it's occurring in all industries and it's across the globe, and our clients are all experiencing a tight labor market. So for us as it relates to inflation in wages, we see for our business that we will continue to have wage increases in the market for certain skills, and that varies by geographies and we expect it really to continue. So what are we doing? It's not so different from what other clients are doing. We're focused on pricing to absorb our higher labor costs. And one other thing that we pointed out, Lisa, that we were very pleased with the improved pricing that we had this quarter on our record bookings, but we have more work to do. And so as one of the things that I want to just point out that it's just going to take some time for the improved pricing to flow through our P&L, and that's going to lead to higher compensation that we see. It may even result for us in some operating margin contraction in Q2, although we expect to continue to expand margin by 10 to 30 basis points for the full year. So I mean, that's just maybe a bit of a glimpse on what it means for us, as we run our own P&L. And I'll hand it over to Julie to give some thoughts on what she's thinking and talking with our clients.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, great. And so, look, we're all managing different aspects, there's wage inflation. There's -- inflation, it's obviously on products. And so -- and it varies by industry in terms of the extent of the impact. And what we really see our clients doing is, because there's a lot of uncertainty about how inflation is going to develop in 2022 is being laser-focused on cost efficiencies and growth, right, because for many industries, they can't pass on the improved pricing, or they're like us, right. It takes a while to be able to do that. And so it is helping as well, drive some of the demand for both things, helping them grow, but also do that efficiently.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up, maybe a follow-up on Tien-tsin's question. So clearly, the level of demand you're seeing is sort of surprised even you guys have a very good handle on it all the time. So if you can just give some color around what your senses about what's happening, like what's happening out in the marketplace. You said it's very broad based across industries across geographies. And so maybe just sort of from a narrative perspective, what's your sense of what's happening differently or differently than you expected even 3 months ago in terms of -- that's driving dramatic increase in demand? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. I think a big aspect of it is embracing the need for speed. And so you are continuing to see more and more companies doing the compressed transformation, the willingness to take on more at the same time and even to do that faster. And just think we have a couple of calls I had just this past week, clients that we've been working with, on some -- for some time speaking about their cloud journey, I wouldn’t call me up Monday and say, okay, we're going to pull forward Wave 2. We've got to go faster. It's harder than we thought we need to go faster. And in so there's this, as companies are kind of getting into it, they're seeing that they want to go even faster, they're also seeing the impact of those who come ahead. I was recently talking to the CEO of a company where we're doing a major cloud and data platform, and his point, so as we speak, okay, now I get it, I can only go so fast, but can you go faster, because I now see what I can really do one side replatform, right. And so, this embracing more change and speed, we do think is helping drive this demand. And we predicted the sort of -- remember, we talked about compressed transformation, that it's really only been in about a third of industries, and that it was going to continue to expand. But the point is, the first round of compressed transformation is just the first round. And as you begin to see the power of what it is to be in the cloud, the next steps of opportunities are being seen by the clients. And so I do think it's mostly around a recognition of the value of replatforming and the need for speed competitively.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you and happy holidays.\nJulie Sweet: Happy holidays.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Congrats on these numbers. Happy holidays. Maybe a little bit more to follow-up on some of these top line questions. You mentioned the pipeline still remains robust after the very strong Q1 bookings. So how should we be thinking about second quarter bookings growth in both consulting and outsourcing relative to the Q1 levels?\nKC McClure: Thanks, Jason, Happy Holidays to you too. We do feel good about our pipeline and -- for the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. So, but bookings can be lumpy. So there's nothing that I would project to, obviously one way or the other against Q1, Jason. But for both outsourcing and consulting, and across all of our markets and the services within those we do feel really good.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Okay, got it. Got it. So we will have to account for some of that lumpiness. And I'm wondering also, if there's been any noticeable change in average project sizes or conversion cycles of backlog into revenue. And then just anything you may want to comment on regarding updated assumptions for consulting and outsourcing revenue growth in full year fiscal '22? Thanks, again.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. So there's really no change, Jason, to anything that we're seeing in duration or in conversion. I mean, it all depends on the mix of the work that we're selling. But every individual type of service there's no change within those durations or mixes. And then just in terms of what we're seeing for the full year, I'll just comment on the type of work we see. Consulting, strong double digits, even probably stronger than what we saw, obviously, at the beginning of the year. And outsourcing now, a double-digit growth.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, and it's probably worth reminding what KC said earlier, right, our expectations were exceeded across all sizes. And obviously, when small deals are also over delivering that in quarter revenue, right. So it's really -- it is broad based.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, appreciate all that. Thanks, again, guys.\nKC McClure: Sure.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Bourgeois: Hey, guys. Congrats on the results and the color that you're providing here. I just have one question. I'd like if you could comment on your newer offerings, it'd be helpful to know which of your newer offerings are showing the most uptick against this growth wave? If you could weigh the relative amount of lift that you're getting from offerings like Industry X, Cloud, Automation, et cetera, is there a certain newer offering that's getting more uptick than the others? Or is it again -- I mean maybe you can go beyond the everything is good comment and give a little more color on the specific offerings? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Sure. Thanks, Rod. I'll give you a little bit more color, maybe on some of the numbers and hand it over to Julie to add anything she'd like to. But what you'll see is on Cloud, Industry X, Interactive Security, I mean they're all at scale, they're all strong or very strong double-digit growth. And so, there's really not what I would call out individually. Julie also mentioned another other list of our strategic priorities within her commentary at the beginning of the call. So I won't be redundant and go through this again. But Julie is there anything you want to add in terms of additional color?\nJulie Sweet: Well, sure. I mean, so first of all, you just have to remember scale, right. So Accenture Cloud First was a $12 billion business. Our cloud business overall, is $12 billion business is down $80 billion business, right. So that's what we announced last quarter. And so when cloud is very strong, double-digit growth is obviously adding big dollars, but across each of the strategic priorities. So obviously, it would be a different scale. But, look, you have to look at the cloud, right? Because the cloud is the enabler. Think about it this, cloud is the enabler, data is the driver and then AI will be the differentiator for our clients. And so you saw many, many of the examples, really bringing these things together, right, so that you've got to get to the cloud, you got to get a handle on your data, right, and then be able to use AI. And we saw that in many of the examples that I gave in the script today. And so the first big step is, of course, replatforming in the cloud, both through migration and SaaS [ph] products. So just if you kind of have that mental model, I think it's helpful and then that goes across the organization.\nRod Bourgeois: Well explained. Thanks.\nAngie Park: Next question.\nOperator: And we have a question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Good morning, and congrats on these superior results. I'd like to ask about the sustainability of the compressed digital transformation. Can you give us some proof points that you're still in the early innings of this transformation, especially in some of your largest practices like Cloud First and Interactive?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. So a few things, right. So -- and we shared this last quarter that if you look at -- you have to build your digital core, right? So if you look at platforms like Oracle, SAP and they're moving to the cloud, those are all well below 50% of their installed base having moved, right? The sort of move to the cloud itself, the percentages are still around 30%-ish, maybe a little bit more in terms of workloads that have moved to the cloud, right? So if you just sort of look at kind of where are we just technically, right, you see a lot of waves. Then you look at our own research, where we talked about leaders and leapfroggers. And what we see is that about 10% on average of every company are really leaders and performing much better than the bottom 25%. But that's only still a part of their organization. They're still working on lots of compressed transformation, you've got these leapfroggers are coming from behind, that's about -- we estimate about a third are really doing compressed transformation. And those compressed transformation is wave on wave, right. Once you get to the cloud, and what do you do with the data. So, we continue to see this as really being a multiyear journey. And I will tell you that a lot of people will talk about the pandemic accelerated, years of transformation into months. That's only in thinking, right? It is really hard to re-platform, right. And then -- and it's really hard to move, get your data under control, and then be able to do that. Once you do it, it opens up so much. But there's a lot of hard work for our clients ahead, and we're privileged to get to be their partner.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, could you comment on where you are with Industry X in terms of the innings of the growth of this business? I mean, clearly, we've got huge supply chain problems currently. I mean, how long do you think supply -- the supply chain problems will last as you look around the globe?\nJulie Sweet: Well, that's always -- we talk about that with our clients all the time, right? Because, look, the supply chain problems there's kind of the immediate issues, but there's the longer term issues like the ports are not, up to snuff in most of the markets around the world, right? There's fundamental shifts going on, in terms of how do you get -- how do you build resilience, which has been moving from sort of cost to resilience. And so, the work of supply chain is multi year. But I think it's important, just -- I always go back to kind of where we were. The new technologies have really only come online, some of the newer platforms like Blue Yonder Luminate or SAP. As for supply chain work in the last couple of years, right. And so they're just starting to really get the momentum and the implementation. And so I would say the digital supply chain work is very, very early innings and the same with manufacturing. That's why we call it the next frontier. It's a big focus. I mean, I think Gartner had a survey that said 93%, or 91% of directors believe it's the biggest transformation opportunity. But we're in very, very early innings still.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Happy holidays.\nJulie Sweet: Happy holidays.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna Please go ahead.\nJamie Friedman: Hi. Good morning. Nice work here. Good way to finish the year. I was just -- oh, I don't think anyone asked about travel yet. And if they did, I apologize, if I missed it. But KC, what are you contemplating in terms of travel for fiscal '22 at this point?\nKC McClure: Jamie, on travel, it's no change to the assumptions that we had at the beginning of the year. So two components to travel, revenue from reimbursable travel, we don't have that in our guidance at the beginning of the year and there's no travel revenue assumed. And if it changes, we'll let you know. And then in terms of travel, outside of contract travel to clients, we continue to have an uptick in our expenses forecasted for the back half of the year, which again continues to be difficult to accurately estimate.\nJamie Friedman: Thanks for that. And then either Julie or KC, do you have any early view on calendar '22 IT budgets for your clients? Are those -- I know you'll make your own weather a lot of time, but those rising to what degree? Is it the pace different than it was say last calendar?\nKC McClure: I mean, I would just say that this is kind of when the budgets are getting finalized. So we'll have much more insight next quarter because they get finalized into January. But what we're seeing is, which is reflected in our guidance is continued strong demand.\nJamie Friedman: Got it. Thank you very much.\nAngie Park: Right. Operator, we have time for one more question. And then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Of course. And that last question then comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Happy holidays. The first question I want to ask was, the surprise jump in diamond client adds? I think it was 15 in the quarter, and you did 13 all of last fiscal year. So just trying to get a sense is that something Accenture is specifically doing with the sales force to grab those larger clients? Or is that just a function of the demand environment that people are knocking down your door, even these larger clients that you would think you would already be working with you're not, and they're just continue to add to the number of diamond clients for you guys?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, it's really a function of what we've been talking about, it's compressed transformation, right? It's a function of more clients taking on more change, right, because that's what builds this level of bookings. And we've been talking about that trend, really from the first 6 months after the pandemic, where we had more clients do over $100 million bookings in the first 6 months of that fiscal year. And we continue to see that building as clients recognize how much change they need to do, and that they have to go faster. So that's really what we see is the function.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Got it. And then KC, when just looking at the numbers on for the revenue growth, obviously a 27% constant currency number for the quarter. And then the guide, I think, for 2Q was above street expectations 22% to 26%. I guess, what does that imply for the back half of the year. Obviously, it would be a much different growth rate in the back half. Is that some conservatism versus just tougher comps? Can you talk about the back half for '22?\nKC McClure: Sure. What that implies in the back half is very -- it's still very strong and that it's double digits across the back half of the year at the low end and the upper end of our guidance range, which implies also really strong organic growth in the back half of the year. And a continuing build of our business in the back half of the year, coming out of the first half of the year, overall.\nBryan Keane: But nothing specific to call out in terms of any weakness you see in the back half, but it's just a function of how the demand lays out?\nKC McClure: Correct.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks so much, and Happy Holidays again.\nKC McClure: Same to you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Bryan. Okay. I think that was our last question. So thank you for joining us on today's call. And thank you again to our really incredible people across the globe. And thanks to all of our shareholders for your continued trust. We work to earn it every day and we really appreciate it. So best wishes to all for a safe, healthy and joyful holiday season.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for replay after 10 A.M.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAngie Park: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.  On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.  Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results; KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.  Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.  During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.  Now let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Angie, and thank you, everyone, for joining. I would like to begin by honoring the incredible bravery of the Ukrainian people in the face of the unlawful invasion by Russia and extending our deep sympathy and concern over the horrific losses of life. While these words don't feel adequate to capture what is happening, we are taking actions to help in the small ways we can, which I will share more about later in the call.  Turning now to the quarter. I will start by thanking our almost 700,000 people around the world for your incredible dedication and work to create 360-degree value for our clients and all our stakeholders. Thank you to our clients who are making bold moves to transform and putting their trust in us to help them. Finally, thank you to our technology ecosystem partners we work with every day to innovate and create more value for our clients.  Now a few highlights from the quarter. We had record bookings of almost $20 billion and continued improved pricing, which refers to contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell across the business with 36 clients with bookings over $100 million. We had record revenue growth of 28% in local currency, bringing total revenue added through H1 to $6.2 billion, which is what we added in all of FY '21. And our EPS grew 25% year-over-year with flat operating margin and continued significant investment in our business and our people.  Our workforce grew by 24,000 people, demonstrating again our ability to attract top talent at the scale needed by our clients. We were the top scoring company on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index out of more than 400 organizations globally. We were recognized in Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies for the 15th year in a row and by JUST Capital for the sixth consecutive year. Our people completed another 9.2 million training hours this quarter. And we continue to gain market share, growing more than 3x the market.  With such an exceptional quarter, I would like to particularly recognize and thank the incredibly strong delivery teams that underlie these results. Our clients know that our commitments are backed by the outstanding work our people do every day, working side-by-side with them, from shaping the future to building the best systems and platforms to creating amazing new experiences and brands to running critical functions for our clients and everything in between.  Before handing over to KC, let me pause to reflect on the current macro environment. It was almost exactly 2 years ago that we did earnings only 8 days after the pandemic was declared. Then, as now, the world faced incredible uncertainty. We are all watching the events unfold in Ukraine, and there are many potential scenarios which are difficult to predict.  While the circumstances are very different, our focus is the same: on the well-being of our people, serving our clients and staying close to their evolving needs and helping our communities. We emerged from the pandemic an even stronger and more relevant company, and we will use this strength to successfully navigate this environment and fulfill these same 3 goals.  Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were extremely pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations with record new bookings of almost $20 billion, $2.8 billion higher than our previous record set last quarter. Our results reflect very strong double-digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business, which reinforce the relevance of our offerings and capabilities in the market to deliver value for our clients.  We had a very strong Q2 and first half of the year. While we know the environment is uncertain given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, we always call it as we see it. And based on the best information we have today, we are increasing key elements of our full year guidance, which I will cover in more detail later in our call.  Now, let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 28% local currency, increasing $3 billion over Q2 last year and nearly $300 million above the top end of our guided range, driven by broad-based over-delivery across all markets, services and industries with all 13 industries growing double digits. We also continued to extend our leadership position with growth estimated to be more than 3x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly-traded companies.  We delivered EPS in the quarter of $2.54, reflecting 25% growth over adjusted EPS last year, and operating margin of 13.7% was consistent with Q2 of last year. And 10 basis points expansion year-to-date reflects continued significant investments in our people and our business.  Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2 billion and returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We have made investments of $1.8 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 21 transactions in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect to invest approximately $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year.  With that, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were a record at $19.6 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 22% in USD over a very strong Q2 last year, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.3. Consulting bookings were $10.9 billion, a record high, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Outsourcing bookings were also a record at $8.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. We were very pleased with our new bookings, which were driven by both technology services and strategy and consulting, as well as 36 clients with bookings over $100 million.  Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15 billion, a 24% increase in U.S. dollars and 28% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 29% in U.S. dollars and 34% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $6.7 billion, up 19% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, strategy and consulting, technology services and operations all grew very strong double digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 26% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Software & Platforms, Consumer Goods, Retail & Services -- Travel Services and Public Service. In Europe, revenues grew 31% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets.  Looking closer at the countries. Europe was driven by double-digit growth in the U.K., Germany, France and Italy. In Growth Markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. From a country perspective, Growth Markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan, Australia and Brazil.  Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.1% compared with 29.7% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.4%, consistent with the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 7% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, consistent with Q2 last year.  Before I continue, as a reminder, we recognized an investment gain in Q2 last year, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.21. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.2% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.5% for the second quarter last year.  Diluted earnings per share were $2.54 compared with an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.03 in the second quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 41 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 34 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.2 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $165 million. Our cash balance at February 28 was $5.5 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31.  With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.6 million shares for $1.7 billion at an average price of $369.19 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $4.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.  Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $617 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on May 13, a 10% increase over last year. So, at the halfway point of fiscal '22, we have delivered very strong results.  Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. Let's begin with the demand environment. We are experiencing double-digit growth in all parts of our business across all markets, industries and services. All our growth priorities, Applied Intelligence, Cloud, Industry X, Intelligent Operations, Intelligent Platform Services, Interactive, Security and transformational change management all are growing double digits. Many of our clients are taking on bold transformation programs, often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise in an accelerated time frame, which we call compressed transformation, as they recognized the need to transform every part of their enterprise with technology, data and AI and new ways of working.  What is also clear is that the sheer speed at which an enterprise now needs to move and the breadth of the expertise required to transform demands partnerships. For example, our wide range of managed services from Intelligent Operations to application development and maintenance to Cloud, infrastructure and security, our strategic capabilities that enable our clients to digitize faster, access hard-to-hire talent, transform more quickly due to our deep expertise and achieve outcomes from greater efficiency to improved customer satisfaction, to enhance security, to faster development, to higher growth.  Our managed services are unique because they combine our strong strategy and consulting capabilities to anticipate and shape the future and be at the cutting-edge of industry, function and technology. We also see our clients looking for partners who can create 360-degree value, upskilling our people, focusing on enhancing diversity and building in sustainability, which is our focus.  Stepping back, when you think about the extraordinary growth we are experiencing and how we navigated the pandemic, we believe our commitment to create 360-degree value for all our stakeholders and our unmatched diversity of people, services, industries, functions, markets, ecosystem partners and investments, together with our leadership and technology, have made us both relevant to the world's largest companies and resilient.  I will now bring to life how we are partnering with our clients with a snapshot of the range of solutions we are bringing across industries and across the enterprise. Let's start with enterprise functions. In chemicals and natural resources, we are expanding our relationship with a leading chemical manufacturer to carve out one of their business units serving the automotive industry to better focus on sustainable solutions.  As part of this carve-out, we will build the backbone of this new entity with a cloud-based infrastructure, ERP platforms and Intelligent Operations managed services for technology, HR and finance, all in just over 1 year. This compressed transformation will create new value, reduce operating costs by up to 30%, enhance portfolio flexibility and enable future growth in new areas.  In consumer goods and services, we are working with a large multinational personal care corporation to build an integrated digital core with standardized processes, IT enterprise platforms and instant access to consolidated data in the cloud, which will enable a more efficient and flexible supply chain and digital order processing. This will provide more time to sell, reduce human error, create a better customer experience and deliver a stronger bottom line. We will also streamline financial operations, leading to greater agility and cost benefits to remain competitive in any environment and delight their consumers.  Now I will turn to our solutions helping transform the core operations of our clients. In high tech, we are supporting Airbus, a leading aircraft manufacturer in several areas of their business, including digital design, manufacturing and services. With our acquisition of umlaut, we're also helping Airbus engineering and manufacturing teams to develop the new A350F. At the same time, we will also onboard and manage training for new frontline employees using a realistic digital twin pilot, optimizing onboarding time and significantly reducing the learning curve of shop floor workers without disturbing production.  In Banking & Capital Markets, we are helping BBVA, a global financial services firm, synchronize and speed up its digital journey. With the power of analytics, AI and automation, we will create an intelligent data-driven banking operation with greater agility and productivity, lowering costs by up to 30% by leveraging our strategic managed services, improving their customer experience and becoming an integral part of their talent strategy to provide new growth opportunities, upskilling and security opportunities. This builds on our work with this digital leader that spans over 25 years, including international expansion, capital market strategy and digital sales and services.  In Health, we are helping Highmark Health, a national blended health organization to make Health care more personalized and proactive through the power of technology and data. By leveraging the cloud and operational hub, we'll bridge business units, consolidate enterprise data, provide faster insights and personalize the customer experience with the flexibility to evolve as needs change. By maximizing its key asset data, Highmark Health will see faster time to market, reduce operational costs and increase innovation and most importantly, better health outcomes.  And we are helping clients accelerate their growth agenda. In consumer goods and services, we are collaborating with Del Monte, the iconic fresh and packaged food company, to establish effective B2B2C and direct-to-consumer commerce platforms. We will transition and scale their existing platforms into a one commerce ecosystem to make it easier to create and launch new products, driving significant growth in their e-commerce revenue.  We are helping with clients to help shape and deliver on the significant emerging opportunity of the Metaverse. We've been an early innovator in this area backing -- going back a number of years, investing in R&D, our people and our own metaverse, One Accenture Park, all of which positions us to help our clients accelerate their Metaverse strategies and initiatives.  In communications and media, we are helping Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications company, to deploy 5G connectivity and technology to deliver immersive fan experiences at Melbourne's Marvel Stadium. From booking a seat to parking, to engaging with a match, fans will soon be able to experience a new augmented reality stadium experience before, during and after they attend the game. And if you missed the release yesterday, please be sure to read our new technology vision, which is titled, Meet Me in the Metaverse, and is available on our website. And we are building the digital cores of our clients from replatforming in cloud to building core systems as described in many of the examples above, to helping them secure their enterprise as the security landscape widens.  In Life Sciences, we are working with Merck, a global pharmaceutical leader to create robust intangible value across the organization, which will help enable growth, accelerate the development of life-changing therapies for patients around the world. We will develop a more flexible and responsive IT infrastructure in the cloud, leveraging data and analytics and product-centric methodologies to power innovation, insight and speed. At the same time, we are cultivating IT talent through a new operating model that drives upskilling, diversity and development.  Also in Life Sciences, we are expanding our partnership with an international drug wholesale company, which advances development and delivery of health care products, including life-saving cancer treatments and COVID vaccines around the world to support their suite of cybersecurity towers by creating an integrated delivery model to increase resilience, accountability, collaboration and feedback across monitoring, engineering, data protection, risk and compliance and identity while also reducing costs.  And we are helping our clients...\nUnidentified Company Representative: [Technical Difficulty]\nJulie Sweet: I'm sorry?\nUnidentified Company Representative: The call dropped.\nJulie Sweet: Has the call dropped?\nUnidentified Company Representative: No, I think it's still going.\nJulie Sweet: Sorry about that, everyone. I just want to make sure, confirm that we're good. Apologies. If you can hear me, we heard the call apparently dropped. We're good. Okay.  So let's go back to we're helping our clients put sustainability in their core. We are helping a leading steel and mining company move to low-carbon steelmaking and employ decarbonization technologies. As an end-to-end partner supporting the company's ambitious decarbonization program, we will help standardize and implement the technical solution among its sites.  I would now like to briefly comment on how Accenture as a company and our people have mobilized to support our Ukrainian colleagues and provide humanitarian aid. When people ask me what makes Accenture special, our actions like these are what come to mind. While we do not have operations or people who work in the Ukraine, we have many Ukrainians who work for us, particularly in Poland. For their extended families who are in Ukraine, we quickly put in place Ukrainian language telehealth and other remote support services. And for those family members who are leaving the Ukraine, we are providing the settlement assistance.  I also am proud of our people who have volunteered to drive refugees from the border to help get them settled. With a decade of experience helping refugees, we knew that not-for-profit organizations operating in Ukraine and the border countries providing humanitarian relief would have an initial immediate need for cash. We are currently donating $5 million in cash to these organizations.  In addition, our people have donated nearly $1.5 million in our employee giving program, and we are providing 100% match funding. Our people also have sprung into action to anticipate the next needs of refugees. In Poland, we are piloting the first addition of an Accenture Academy for women refugees from Ukraine to build their technology skills starting in cybersecurity.  Finally, as we've shared, we are discontinuing our business in Russia. We are working to support our nearly 2,300 employees there, and we want to thank them for their dedication and commitment to Accenture over the years.  Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Before I get into our business outlook, I would like to provide some context as events are rapidly evolving and there's significant amount of uncertainty. Our third quarter and full year guidance does not include any assumption for a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope.  Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.7 billion to $16.15 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 4 compared to the third quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 22% to 26% growth in local currency.  For the full fiscal year '22, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '21. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 24% to 26% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which continues to assume an inorganic contribution of about 5%.  For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2%, a 10 basis point expansion of our fiscal '21 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21.  For earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $10.61 to $10.81 or 21% to 23% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. For the full fiscal '22, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.  Finally, we now expect to return at least $6.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.  With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?\nA - Angie Park: Thanks, KC. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Good stuff here. And yes, Julie, we could hear you the whole time. I don't think the call dropped. Can you talk a little bit about, given you guys are very global and very much on the front lines with major corporations, how -- what impact or changes are you seeing companies start to make with the work they're doing with Accenture in response to the macroeconomic environment, meaning to deal with inflation or supply chain challenges or sanction enforcement or anything like that? What are some of these -- are you seeing -- starting to see some conversations going, some shifts or interest in doing different types of programs with you?\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Lisa. Great question because we're talking to our clients all the time. And I guess, let me just start with, I think the experience of the pandemic has just built in more of a sense of resilience and agility. And so we're seeing really a lot of what I call calm in response to the macro environment. I mean the reality is that it's very early. And while there are lots of like predictions around what could happen with inflation, what could happen with supply chain, people are not overreacting. And instead, what I'd say is they're remaining very focused on the priorities they had before the crisis because as you talk about, inflation is already a reality, right?  And we're already living that. And so for inflation, depending on the industry, like, for example, consumer goods, there's been a lot of focus on growth and cost, right, with cost being even higher up because you're seeing that you can't push through all of the -- and price increases, all of the increases in input. Of course, as you think about the potential scenarios around like disruption of agriculture and so on, we could see that potentially going higher, but it's too early to tell. And instead, companies are saying, look, we've got to make sure that we're on pace, and we're executing. The same as I think about energy prices. Supply chain, if anything, there's just been an increased focus on we need to think as much about resilience, right, as cost in supply chain. And we absolutely have to digitize so we've got more insight.  And so I think the trends that we were already seeing to address, things coming out of the pandemic, the changing economic environment around inflation are simply being focused on even more. And this premium on are we building in agility and are we going at the right pace, that's really the nature of the conversations.\nLisa Ellis: Got it. Okay. Okay. And then maybe my follow-up, KC, for you. I'll ask the inevitable margin question. It looked like -- I know Julie made a comment about contract pricing being up. It looks like gross margins are up, but SG&A also was up a bit, and then you're coming in at the lower end of your margin expectation. Can you just talk a little bit about the drivers there, what's going on in the underlying cost base?\nKC McClure: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Lisa. So let me first start with, we were really pleased with our performance in operating margin. So we've expanded 10 basis points to the first half of the year. And we were flat in the second quarter. And really, that was driven by revenue growth, as we mentioned, with -- that had improved pricing on our record bookings. So very pleased with profit this quarter, including the 25% growth that we delivered in EPS.  And so let's -- let me just peel that back a bit. So we're in a hypergrowth environment where we're hiring at elevated levels to meet this demand. So at the same time, as you know, we're navigating wage inflation. So Lisa, we remain very focused on pricing, knowing that it's going to take some time for the improved pricing, which lags compensation to flow through our P&L, but we did see some impact to that in this second quarter results.  I think probably more importantly, it's really very important that we significantly invest in our people and our business and we're doing so at even higher levels than last year. So we're absorbing that also in our up margin as well as the step-up that we've talked about in our acquisition spend.  So just in summary, we're halfway through the year. We're 10 basis points of margin expansion. We think we'll continue to that level of margin expansion in the back half of the year. Really pleased with that. And that would mean an EPS growth, which is stellar at 21% to 23% growth for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Congratulations on these great results. I had 2 questions. I guess the first one is, given the disruption to some of the digital engineering IT service firms in Eastern Europe, are you seeing additional demand from clients looking to other vendors?\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Bryan. It's really too early to see that. We're seeing clients staying very focused on their business and what we're doing with them.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And the other thing that jumped out at me is the 3x growth rate versus the market. I think typically, Accenture has been more of a 2x in recent years. So can you just talk to us about why the expansion and share gains that's happened over just recently here?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. It's really, I think, a combination of things, right, but let's just always start with our clients. Prepandemic, what we saw were clients much more into -- they did transformation quite sequentially, right? The pandemic was a major shock. You saw the leaders who are kind of coming into that saying we've got to go even faster. And you saw a bunch of companies saying, we need to leapfrog, right? We need to move online. We need to do digital transformation.  And that meant that we saw companies starting to take on -- not sequential transformation, but what we call compressed transformation, where they're, at the same time, doing manufacturing as well as sales. And you saw that in some of the examples that I gave today where you've got entirely new backbones being created across multiple enterprise functions, where you've got both new platforms being put into place and manufacturing. And they're doing that in order to lead because of what they see in the business.  And when you think about who is able to help navigate, because you don't do that kind of transformation with like a different partner for every transformation, right? Accenture is very distinctive in our industry because we are able to transform every part of the enterprise. And that's one of the things I was trying to emphasize. Like we can do -- we're going to finance in HR, right? We've got the growth agenda, sales, marketing and service, right? We've been investing for a decade in Industry X, which is really taking off. We talked about the digital frontier.  And so you have in Accenture a partner that can do that. And you see that over the course of the last 2 years in the record numbers compared to prepandemic of clients with over $100 million in bookings. And it's really -- it's recognizing, it's representing that level of demand. And we're quite unique. Like we've talked about this for years, right? All of our different services, our deep industry knowledge. And when you're moving fast, you need a partner that really can span the enterprise and has that deep knowledge of the industry. And that is, of course, driving the growth, right? Because we are capturing the momentum in every part of the enterprise that's happening now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great results here. Just wanted to clarify your assumptions on the really strong outlook. Can we assume that your approach towards guidance is similar to the approach you took at the onset of the pandemic? And are you assuming any slowdown in Europe in your guide? I know there's a lot of questions we're giving on macro within Europe, so figured I'd just ask it here.\nKC McClure: Yes. So thanks, Tien-Tsin. So let me just cover what we're assuming in our guidance. So -- and maybe I'll first start with our guidance does take into account the revenue impact of discontinuing our business in Russia and the cost to wind that down.  Now with respect to the broader risk, our guidance, we're calling it like we see it, Tien-Tsin. So the same way that we did -- we always do, we did during the pandemic. And today, we don't see a significant disruption in our business. Now it's still very early, and it's difficult to predict. So our guidance does not take into account any significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope.  Now as it pertains to Europe, we are not seeing a significant disruption in our business in Europe. You've seen that reflected as well in our very strong bookings and revenue growth. And for the back half of the year, our guidance continues to assume a very strong double-digit growth, including in Europe.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Great. Look, we trust your outlook. I just want to make sure I understood the approach here. Just my quick follow-up, just the 36 clients, over $100 million, big number. I'm just curious if the pipeline for larger deals, how does that look from here your ability to replenish? I know we're in March now, but just curious what you're thinking on larger deals looking ahead here.\nKC McClure: Yes. So I'll comment on the pipeline, Tien-Tsin, and see if Julie wants to add anything else. But we continue to feel good about our pipeline even with another quarter of record bookings just completed. We were very pleased with our bookings, obviously, in Q2 and for the first half of the year. But bookings can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. So we focus on the trailing 12-month book-to-bill as I know many of you do, too. But we, overall, still feel really good about our pipeline.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And Tien-Tsin, the only one thing I want to add maybe back to your last question is, we are doing exactly what we did at the pandemic, which is we're calling it like we see it, right? So we'll update every quarter. And we've got -- we're really close to the clients, right? And as we said at the beginning, it is too early. So we're not trying to build in, be overly conservative or overly optimistic. Like we really just call it down the fairway. And next quarter, we'll update and we'll go from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Just wanted to ask about the bookings, obviously, extremely strong here. I was just curious on the consulting and outsourcing side. How much above your internal expectations did they come in? And how should we think about book-to-bill in the back half of the year? I know year-to-date, it's nicely elevated at 1.2x. So should we just expect some normalization there in the back half?\nKC McClure: Jason, I would say that our bookings -- our record bookings did come in higher than we expected. That was a broad-based over-delivery across all markets, all services and industries as well as consulting and outsourcing type of work. And again, we look at an overall book-to-bill, as I just mentioned to Bryan, in a trailing 12 months, 4 quarters at a time. So, we feel good about where we are and our positioning and our pipeline and our bookings to date as we head into H2.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. All right. Understood. And then can you just remind us which countries within Central and Eastern Europe you have the most meaningful headcount, obviously, excluding Russia? But I know you mentioned Poland earlier, but just so we have a broader picture of the headcount distribution in the region?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. Poland and Romania would be the sort of the two where we've got delivery centers. We don't have big local market, but Poland and Romania.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman: Julie, I wanted to direct this to you. And the nature of the question is, I wanted to get your view about the durability of double-digit growth. And I'm not focused on this year. So, our model goes back to 2006 for Accenture. So, 2006 to 2021, Accenture grew on average, by about 8 points, which includes some M&A. Half of those years were in the double-digit range, half were not. And so, I'm just trying to think and I think investors are really focused on the phenomenal year that you're having this year, but it sets up: a, a very difficult compare, including 5 points of M&A; and b, a lot of companies, including my firm, came out of COVID and said, we need to do a lot of things differently. So, stressing -- trying to fix our IT infrastructure and -- may have created some pull-ins. The things we're going to do over the next 5 years, many firms are doing over the next 1 year. So, I wanted to get your -- with that as a context, how do you see, as you look out to 2023 and beyond, how do you view Accenture's ability to sustain double-digit growth?\nJulie Sweet: I love that you look at it over the long term because that's how we do. And so, the way we think about growth isn't about, is it double digit or not, right? We've had a very enduring and I think it served us well, belief that we should be growing more than the market, right? And so that is what we focus on, is that we are always continuing to take market share. And that is an enduring commitment that we sort of -- that we anchor to.  Now, the way we do that is that we stay very close to clients so that we know not only what they need today, but also, we can anticipate what they need tomorrow, right? And that's really important. So yesterday, for example, we talked about the Metaverse continuum where we have been investing for a decade. We think the Metaverse and Web3 is as significant as when, in 2013, we called that every business would be a digital business. And that will be a huge transformation over the next decade that will also be part of -- sort of next waves of growth.  At the same time, it's really important to look at where we are now, which is still extraordinarily early in the digital transformation of every part of the enterprise, right? We estimate, for example, that only about 30% of workloads have been -- have moved to the cloud. And once you get to the cloud, that's when you actually use those technologies to grow and innovate. You saw that in some of the examples that we gave today where you're having the cloud piece, but then you're figuring out how to use the data and the AI to really transform.  When you look at replatforming on the leading SaaS platform, similarly, extraordinarily early. So, everyone feels, right, the big focus on digital because that was the wake-up call from the pandemic. But the actual transformation and just putting in the foundation is still very early stages, and then it's what you do on that foundation.  Then if you look at from a technology development point of view, let's take manufacturing and supply chain. Many of the technologies have that are advanced have only been introduced in the last couple of years, right, the advanced cloud-based technologies. And so, technology itself, like there's still new functionality that doesn't even exist in some of the major platforms that's still being created. And so, we consider the manufacturing and supply chain as the next digital frontier. And of course, that was a big play for us, which we've been doing for the last decade because it's a move from IT to OT as you think about the budgets that we're accessing, right?  And so overall, like as much as we feel there's so much going on, you still have many, many companies who’ve not started the compressed transformation. You're very early in the platforming of what's today, let alone the next things that we can already see like Web3.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Great. Very helpful. KC, I'll make my follow-up a bit more poignant question, and just want to try to understand the operating margin comments that you made before. And specifically, is wage inflation impacting that negatively, influencing some of the comments you made about potential for operating margin expansion this year?\nKC McClure: Yes. So in terms of wage inflation, I will -- it's really a pretty similar case to what we've discussed last quarter. So maybe it just kind of goes back through that again. So obviously, it's occurring in all the industries, and it's across the globe. And our clients have also obviously experienced this as well in this very tight labor market.  But for us, as it relates to wage inflation, we see for our business that we're going to continue to have wage increases in the market for certain skills, and that's going to continue to vary by geography. And we're also looking at have the Consumer Price Index and any increases there and how that might potentially spill over into inflation at the lower end of our pyramid.  And so we're focusing on pricing to absorb our higher labor costs. And again, as it relates to pricing, what we're seeing is that it's going to take some time, Keith, for the improved pricing, which we did have in the second quarter, again, on our record bookings. We see that flow through -- see that flow through our P&L. We did see some of that impact in the second quarter, but that obviously lags the impact of compensation increases.\nJulie Sweet: And I'm just going to add -- and I just want to add that I'm very happy with where we are on profitability. I mean if you think about what we are navigating, right, hyper growth has increased costs from all the recruiting, right? We did a big step-up in acquisitions last year. We're absorbing that dilution this year, right? We've increased significantly the investments in our business, which are all about driving growth today, but also tomorrow, right? We're in an unprecedented labor market with wage inflation, which we are absorbing and still delivering at 10 basis points operating margin expansion. So I feel really good about where we are as a company, both for this year and all the things that we're doing to position ourselves to continue to grow in market-leading ways.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Julie, KC, congratulations on the quarter and outlook. I wanted to start with the M&A question. I believe there was no M&A since last earnings. Perhaps I may have missed a smaller deal or 2. Is that just a quirk of timing? Or is it that you just recently did larger deals and are integrating? Or might there be other factors at play?\nKC McClure: Yes. Maybe I'll just state some facts and you can -- yes, so Ash, we're about halfway through the year. And we did have a lot of acquisitions closed in Q1. You're right, we did have less close in Q2. But acquisition closing, they can be lumpy. We can't always control the timing. So we've deployed $1.8 billion of acquisition spend year-to-date. We continue to expect about $4 billion of acquisition spend in FY '22. But of course, we're only going to do deals that make sense. And so it could be plus or minus the $4 billion. And we'll update you next quarter. But let me...\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And I just like I wish we could manage it sort of like say, we're going to do this many and then we're going to absorb. But it really is just about timing goes up and down. And also, we have a lot of rigor and discipline. We're only going to do deals that we believe in, right? So we're not trying to manage in any way to a quarter. We've got a capital allocation. If we can do that with great deals, we're going to do it, and so that's the approach.  I will take the opportunity just to say one of the ones we did announce, we did close 2 this quarter. But one of the ones we announced I'm super excited about, which is AFD.TECH, which is in the network space, 1,600 people in France. And it's important because as you think about what's happening in digitization, our increasing move into really leading in network is important. And it's just another great example of how we use acquisitions to accelerate our strategic growth priorities. It's an important part of Accenture Cloud First.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: No doubt. I agree with that. And I wanted to ask a broader question. This has unfortunately been asked in a few different ways. But I think you captured it well in your takeoff sentence when you mentioned an incredibly high level of uncertainty. But I believe that since the compressed transformation move started, this is probably the first major test of secular trend versus cyclical uncertainty. And I know you're calling outlook like you see it. But is this time different? Can the strength of secular overcome cyclical challenges?\nJulie Sweet: Look, we all rose to dealing with the types of things that may come out of this crisis other than perhaps the military scenarios, right, whether it's more inflation, the need for energy conservation due to higher energy prices, the disruption in supply chain, agriculture. All roads lead to some combination of technology and human ingenuity, right, which is what we bring together. And so, you've got great solutions like managed services to accelerate both cost takeout and finding new ways to grow, new ways to access markets, right? You've got energy efficiency that's going to come from technology improvements.  And so, as you think about what we do, right, we're the company that's going to be able to help companies navigate these macro trends. And so, we really believe that the technology -- importance of technology and then being able to apply it to get tangible outcomes is going to be critical. And so, we believe we'll be resilient through this, through whatever this is going to be as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: The first question I'd like to ask is just about talent and your ability to acquire it more globally. Obviously, in the earlier announcement about the apprenticeship program or the expansion of it in the U.S., can you talk a little bit about as you build out the bottom base of the pyramid for your delivery.How does something like that impact like bill rates or the clients' willingness to accept bill rates when you're using individuals with non-4-year degrees and so forth?\nJulie Sweet: Interesting question. I would say that our clients really focus on skills. They don't focus on degrees. And so, what they're looking for are the skills. And that's a broader trend. In fact, we predicted that 3 years from now, Chief Human Resources officers will all be talking about skills. And as part of this trend, you need to be -- not a consumer, but a creator of talent, understand skills and then be able to reskill.\nSurinder Thind: Fair enough. And does that also impact your cost as well, though? Are you able to employ them at a better cost base, I guess? How should I think about the arbitrage opportunity there if clients are willing to pay for the full skill?\nJulie Sweet: I wouldn't think about the arbitrary opportunity. We pay market-relevant pay. And it's the focus on skills. Even if you look at our -- the way we draft our recruiting thing, it is about skills. And so, there isn't something that because you've got a 2-year degree versus a 4-year degree, now you're paid less. It's about skills. So, there's a market price for these skills. So, I wouldn't think of it as labor arbitrage.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then as a follow-up question, just a big-picture, longer-term question just about the delivery model. Do the current geopolitical events maybe change your perception of where you may want to operate or expand to? There's generally been in the trend of the last few years, much more global delivery. Obviously, you guys are very global. But in terms of just trying to get as much talent in every country everywhere, how does that kind of change the way that you might be thinking about delivery, whether it's being more concentrated in certain regions or areas or avoiding other regions and areas?\nJulie Sweet: What I would say is since the time of the pandemic, when we had this global shock, right, we continued to evolve our ability to move work and be flexible. And so, our focus is really on that agility and making sure that we have the right kinds of talent, both geographically dispersed, but also the ability to move talent around.\nAngie Park: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap the call.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: Great. I echo my congratulations on the results for the quarter. I guess, I wanted to follow up to the last question, maybe a little different angle, focused on the supply side. So, I guess with that` in mind, Julie, are you seeing -- obviously, in a post-pandemic era or hopefully coming out of the pandemic, companies are used to operating in a hybrid world, more agnostic to where work is performed. Any trends that you -- or overarching trends that you can call out either by skill level or by geography where they might, and specifically, would love to focus it on how they're managing costs? So, are they looking to shift work to particular geographies? Do you see demand in particular geographies? Are there certain trends that you can call out with regard to the skilling of labor forces in particular geographies that are notable where you might see some cost benefit or better ability to supply to meet demand?\nJulie Sweet: I'm talking about talent all the time with our clients. And I'd say that it's slightly different than what your focus is. Here are the two big things, which are all around accessing talent. So, in accessing talent, means you have to be able to attract and retain it, and you've got to be able to get it at scale.  So the bigger focus is around what does it take to attract and retain in a hybrid work environment. And so more companies are focused on where they did -- they used to want everybody in the office, having more of a hybrid model, and that has knock-on cost effects as you decrease your real estate. And so that's been a big focus.  But the actual -- the thing we talk to clients about is it's more about how do you attract people who today, all of our research shows that if you're not having to be there in a frontline worker, you want some combination, and then that does have costs. And so that's a huge focus around talent.  The second piece on access, if you look at the way our managed services are being driven, it is really 2 big things. One is it's faster to digitize because you use our platforms. And the second is the access to hard-to-get talent, right? And so let's just take security. We have 10,000 security professionals who do everything from threat assessment to the rebuilding and designing platforms to managed services. And in today's world, with the security landscape broadening, right, that access to that kind of talent is incredible. And so just the real focus is on access and what does it take to access it, including through partnerships. And those are the kinds of conversations that we have.\nBrian Essex: Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe just one quick follow-up on resources. What have you seen historically? I know we've got accelerating energy prices, oil in particular. What have you seen historically with regard to follow-on for alternative projects and greater investment in the energy sector, in particular, in response to prices? How high is it been correlated, particularly on the discretionary side and maybe your experience in terms of how you've seen follow-through with spend in that sector?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Well, listen, I was just at CERAWeek, which is the world's largest energy conference for a couple of days just last week, so I spent a lot of time with everyone in the energy sector. And I think rather than looking at it historically, let's look at it like what are people talking about now. So first of all, despite the increases in prices, say, in oil and gas, no one is saying, \"Hey, now we've got to let up on cost.\" In fact, the exact opposite. Because the oil and gas industry, in fact, the entire energy industry has a major challenge ahead of investing to move to sustainable energy solutions.  And so what I would say is that there is an absolutely laser focus on continuing what that industry had to do during the pandemic because how it was fit and focus on cost and now accelerate innovation and moving to sustainable energy solutions. And that's where we gave the example today of how we're helping in decarbonization. We announced this week what we're doing with Ecopetrol and AWS around water management, right? And so we're playing -- we're obviously very well situated. We have a deep, deep expertise in utilities and oil and gas and the entire energy sector in -- at their core both enterprise as well as in the grid, at the refinery and then helping really create those sustainable solutions. We see this as a major opportunity for our clients that we want to help them on.\nAngie Park: Great. Thank you very much. I'm going to close the call now. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and thank you again to our incredible people and to our shareholders for your continued trust.

Welcome to Accenture's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Angie Park, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAngie Park: Thank you, operator. And thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, and Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results; KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Angie. And thank you everyone for joining. And thank you to our 710,000 people around the globe for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in delivering another very strong quarter of financial results and creating significant 360 degree value beyond our financials for all our stakeholders. Here are a few highlights of the 360 degree value we created this quarter. Starting with our people, we continue to invest in their skills and they completed 10.6 million training hours, which averages to 16 hours per person this quarter. We are incredibly pleased to be recognized as a top 10 Great Place to Work for 2022 in countries representing 76% of our people, Argentina, Brazil, France, India, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, UK and the United States. Specifically on the US list, we are particularly proud that Accenture jumped 38 spots in one year to rank number six. Overall, this is the 14th consecutive year that Accenture has been recognized by great place to work. Also a particular note in India, not only were we ranked number 10 by Great Place to Work, Business Today recognized Accenture in India as number four of the best companies to work for marking our 11th consecutive year on the list. All these recognitions reflect a tangible demonstration of our commitment to our people. The strong demand for our people and services and trust from our clients are once again seen in our strong bookings of $17 billion which represents 15% growth in local currency. Compressed transformation continues with another 18 clients with bookings over $100 million, bringing the total year-to-date to 74, which is 20 more than the same time last year. We had revenue growth of 27% in local currency, continuing to take significant market share growing nearly three times the market while delivering margin expansion of 10 basis points. Our ongoing investment in our communities was reflected this quarter, and how we are leveraging our expertise in digital learning and collaboration, partnering with UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited on the new passport to earning platform program to equip 10 million young people ages 15 to 24 with digital skills across 10 countries to prepare them for work. This program went live this quarter in India, the first and largest country of the 10. As always, well as always, we are staying close to our clients and our ecosystem partners to help them succeed today, and to anticipate the needs of the future. And our very strong financial results this quarter reinforced the trust our clients and partners have in our ability to do so. Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. And thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We delivered very strong overall results in the third quarter, reflecting very strong double digit revenue growth across all dimensions of our business, as well as continued operating margin expansion, as we continue to invest at scale in our business and our people. We continue to lead the industry with these results, demonstrating the relevance of our services, and our trusted client and ecosystem partnerships. We continue to deliver on our shareholder value proposition, including both our financial results and creating 360 degree value for all our stakeholders. Let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter across our three financial imperatives. Revenues grew 27% in local currency. And we're above the top end of our guided range driven once again by broad based over delivery across all markets, services and industries. With all 13 industries growing double digits. We once again extended our leadership position, adding an incremental $9 billion in revenue year-to-date, with growth estimated to be nearly three times the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin up 16.1% for the quarter was an increase of 10 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansions while making significant investments in our people and our business. We delivered EPS of $2.79, which represents 60% growth over fiscal ‘21 results, and includes $0.15 or 6% negative impact related to the disposition of our business in Russia. Finally, we delivered free cash flow, up $2.9 billion and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We've made investments of $2.2 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 27 transactions year-to-date. And we now expect to invest about $2.5 billion in acquisitions this year, with another $1 billion that we expect to close in Q1 given required regulatory approvals With that, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $17 billion for the quarter and overall book-to-bill of 1.0. Consulting bookings were $9.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Outsourcing bookings were $7.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. We were very pleased with our bookings this quarter, which represent our second highest ever, and were in line to our expectations. Our bookings reflect 15% growth in local currency and 18 clients with bookings over $100 million. Looking forward, we continue to have a strong pipeline. Turning now to revenue. Revenues for the quarter were $16.2 billion, a 22% increase in US dollars and 27% in local currency reflecting the foreign exchange headwind of 5% compared to the 4% headwind provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact, we were $160 million above our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9 billion, up 24% in US dollars and 30% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $7.1 billion, up 19% in US dollars and 23% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimension, strategy and consulting and technology services, both grew very strong double digits and operations grew strong double digit. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 23% in local currency driven by double digit growth and consumer goods retail and travel services, public service, software platforms and communications and media. In Europe, revenues grew 30% in local currency led by double digit growth in industrial, consumer goods, retail and travel services, and banking and capital markets. Looking closer at the countries, Europe was driven by double digit growth in Germany, the UK, France and Italy. In growth markets, we delivered 30% revenue growth in local currency driven by double digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, banking and capital markets and public service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double digit growth in Japan and Australia. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, compared with 33.2% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.3% compared with 10.6% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.5% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.6 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16.1% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with Q3 of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 25% for the third quarter of last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.79 including a $0.15 or 6% negative impact related to the disposition of our business in Russia, compared with diluted EPS of $2.40 in the third quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 44 days, compared to 41 days last quarter and 36 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $195 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $6.7 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.1 million shares for $972 million at an average price of $313.43 per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share, for a total of $614 million. This represents a 10% increase over last year, and our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 cents per share to be paid on August 15, a 10% increase over last year. Finally, turning to the 360 degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. We were very pleased to be ranked number 13 on 3BL Media's 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States report, which recognizes outstanding ESG transparency and performance against the Russell 1000, which are the largest companies in the US equity markets. For more information on a 360 degree value weeks, we are creating go to center 360 degree value reporting experience, which reflects new information each quarter. So in summary, we are extremely pleased with our results to date, and are now very focused on Q4 and closing out another very strong year. Now let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. As we shared at our recent Investor and Analyst Day, we believe there are five forces that our clients must harness over the next decade and that in turn will drive our growth. Total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the Metaverse continuum and the ongoing tech revolution. Today, we continue to see strong demand across our markets, services and industries, which is being driven primarily by two of these five forces. Total enterprise reinvention, which involves transformation of every part of every business, leveraging technology, with new ways of working and engaging with customers and employees, and new opportunities for growth and talent, which requires every business to be able to access talent, be a talent creator, not just a talent consumer and to unlock the potential of their people. Compressed transformation continues with our clients seeking to execute bold programs in accelerated timeframes, often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise at the same time, when in the past, they may have taken a more sequential approach. This desire for speed with strong execution is driving our growth as clients partner with us because of the breadth and depth of our capabilities, the insights that come from our scale, global footprint and our deep functional industry and cross industry expertise. And they partner with us because they trust us. And because we are trusted partners with the technology ecosystem, which are also critical to our clients transformation. While the current macroeconomic environment affects industries and markets differently. The common theme across our clients is that all strategies whether for growth, cost or resilience, lead to technology, particularly cloud data and AI, and our clients turn to us to be able to effectively use technology to achieve their goals. Let me bring this demand environment to life. We help our clients execute total enterprise reinvention by helping them build their digital core, optimize operations and accelerate growth. Cloud Data and AI are fundamental to a strong digital core. We are working with the Clorox company, a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of homecare, household and health and beauty products for consumers, as well as products and technologies for professional customers. The company is undertaking a broad digital transformation that will touch every aspect of the enterprise. We will help the company modernize business processes, streamline their operating model, leverages advanced data and analytic insights and establish a future ready technology foundation to deliver new levels of customer and consumer experiences, accelerate go- to-market activities and enable a more agile and resilient supply chain so they can lead and shape the consumer goods industry. We are helping new look, a global fashion retailer migrate its existing ecommerce platform to the cloud and strengthen its technology foundation to enable a seamless experience across stores, online, mobile and social media. AI and machine learning will create greater efficiency, increased sales and provide the flexibility to scale for growth and overcome industry disruption. The company is committed to infusing sustainability into their transformation roadmap, using innovation as an accelerator toward their own 2040 sustainability targets, all of which promises to keep the company in step with the store of the future, the speed of the fashion industry and the demands of their stakeholders. And as we build the digital course of our clients, security is more important than ever. Our integrated capabilities from identity to threat intelligence to manage security services to incident response are critical as our clients respond to increasing risks and expand their digital footprint. We are helping a large healthcare services provider assess their cybersecurity and business resilience levels. With much of their growth coming through mergers and acquisitions, technology and security have become more challenging to manage with multiple security providers, data centers and environments. We help design a cloud strategy and secure their backups in the cloud with an end-to-end cybersecurity approach that will provide flexibility as they continue to acquire more companies. We are also providing a managed security service from cyber resilience to threat intelligence to monitor their infrastructure and their security products, improving their ability to protect against future attacks. Our clients value our unique combination of capabilities from strategy and consulting to technology to manage services, because it enables us to deliver holistic solutions and expands their access to digital talent. We are helping INFRONEER Holdings, a Japan based infrastructure construction services company, digitally transform operations in finance and HR through a data driven approach. Through our managed services capabilities in our SynOps platform, we will help the company shift to intelligent operations by standardizing and automating key business processes, driving efficiency and productivity, reducing operating costs and providing greater opportunity for their people to focus on high value and strategic growth areas such as business design and digital experience. Shifting to the next digital frontier in the enterprise, our industry X capabilities are digitizing engineering and manufacturing to reimagine the products our clients make and how they make them and to build a greater resiliency, productivity and sustainability. We are partnering with a German multinational corporate manufacturer of luxury vehicles to develop an in-car software platform that will power the Central Intelligence Unit for personalized driver interaction information, convenience functions and entertainment. The platform provides a continuous flow of customer data to the automaker, enabling it to enhance vehicle functionality and create the superior customer experience, the automaker is renowned for. We are helping Albras, the largest producer of primary aluminum in Brazil to increase its productivity, energy efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas emissions by creating a new smelter control system operated over a new IoT architecture that utilizes cloud platforms for data storage and machine learning. Data insights will enable better visibility of gas emissions around the clock, allowing operations to be proactively managed, leading to increase energy efficiency and operational safety, as well as additional sustainability strategies to reduce their carbon footprint. Sustainability, one of the five forces shaping the next decade continues to be a growing priority area for our clients. And they value our ability to help them achieve their sustainability goals as part of their larger transformation such as the Albras example and directly as part of sustainability focused engagements, such as the work we are doing for Pos Malaysia Berhad, the national operator running Malaysia's largest post and parcel delivery network, we are helping Pos Malaysia Berhad to embrace a data driven approach to reducing emissions, cutting waste and upgrading its employees’ digital skills, best-in- class solutions for environmental, social and governance benchmarking, plus a sustainability implementation roadmap and skills for the future program will lead to dramatic reductions in direct waste and Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions along with rapid progress and workforce upskilling. We continue to build our capabilities in this area both organically and inorganically. We are pleased that this quarter we announced three new sustainability acquisitions; Greenfish, akzente and Avieco, extending our reach and enhancing our ability to deliver deep skills and expertise to clients in ESG measurement and non-financial reporting, net zero strategy and regulation and real time data analytics. Our unmatched ability to access, create and unlock talent is valued by our clients as a key component of their compressed transformations, such as Pos Malaysia Berhad. In other cases, we help provide our clients access to talent through our managed services, and we help them become talent creators by having their shared services groups join Accenture where they can benefit from our ability to transform, upskill and provide new career pathways. For example, we are working with BNL a leading Italian banking group and subsidiary at BNP Paribas on a compressed transformation just 18 months from start to finish that will leverage our SynOps platform, maximize our clients’ existing talent and reduce total cost of ownership. We will consolidate data to provide deeper analytic insights and a better customer experience with tailored services and faster fulfillment times for customer requests. As part of this transformation, more than 500 people from their team will move to Accenture, where we will leverage their industry specific skills while also providing opportunities for professional development, enabling BNL to focus on strategic growth and benefit from this upskilling. We also do work with our clients that is primarily focused on their talent agenda. For example, we're collaborating with a large utility who is creating 1000s of clean energy jobs in areas like renewable electricity generation, energy saving homes and buildings and sustainable transportation. They're doing so for unemployed, underemployed and low to middle income residents. We are developing a recruitment, employment and tracking platform that matches people’s skills, with available positions leveraging AI and market insights. This solution reduces hiring time, improves the candidate experience and unlocks talent potential to create jobs for the underrepresented residents who need the most. We are uniquely positioned to help our clients drive cost efficiencies and their growth agenda. As you may have seen Accenture Interactive will now go-to-market as Accenture Song to reflect the fundamental change in the way companies must engage with customers, and the incredible speed at which they need to operate and innovate. Song is uniquely operating at the intersection of creativity, technology and intelligence. To help our clients reinvent connections and meaningful experiences, including sales, commerce, marketing, new business platforms, and the Metaverse continuum. We are helping a North American multi brand retailers scale their digital business and accelerate growth while reducing operational costs up to $100 million over the next five years. Together, we are designing and implementing a new multiproduct platform to improve the customer experience and enable the use of data and insights to drive increased engagement and better business performance overall. While still very early, we are seeing our clients look to take advantage of the Metaverse, another of the five forces. For example, we are collaborating with an international property developer, MQDC to develop their business model and design their customer experience in the Metaverse. As you can tell, this continues to be an exciting time for Accenture as the depth and breadth of our business allows us to help our clients with innovative and impactful work. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks Julie. Turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal ’22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative eight, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal ‘21 and reflects an estimated 20% to 24% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year ’22, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be approximately negative 4.5% compared to fiscal ‘21. For the full fiscal ’22, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 25.5% to 26.5% growth in local currency over fiscal ‘21 which continues to assume an inorganic contribution of roughly 5%. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year ‘22 to be 15.2%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal ‘21 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal ‘21. For earnings per share, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal ‘22 to be in the range of $10.61 to $10.70 or 21% to 22% growth over adjusted fiscal’ 21 results. This guidance range reflects a negative $0.14 impact from the updated FX guidance, partially offset by the increase in revenue guidance. For the full fiscal ’22, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion. Property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $6.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Angie?\nAngie Park: Thanks KC. I would ask that you each key to one question and a follow up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang.\nTien Huang: Thank you so much. Good morning. Really good results here. I want to ask on the -- let me ask bookings, which came in line with your expectations. In the book-to-bill and a quarter look like more a like pre-pandemic levels on tough comps. So, KC, I heard the strong pipeline comment. Just wondering, can we expect book-to-bill above 1.0 but maybe below the 1.1 or higher that we saw during the pandemic, just trying to better understand how the pace of bookings might be changing here beyond the comp?\nKC McClure: Yes, thanks, Tien-Tsin. So let me just start with anchoring to what we saw this quarter in bookings and our pipeline, and I'll talk then a little bit about what we expect for Q4. So as you mentioned, we were really pleased with our book-to-bill this quarter. And you talked about our tough comps, we did 30% growth in consulting. And we have year-to-date of 1.1 book-to-bill in consulting through Q3. We're very pleased with that. And outsourcing, we did 23% revenue growth, again over tough comps from last year in the quarter at 1.2 year-to-date book-to-bill. So as we look ahead at Q4, we do see continued very strong revenue growth of 20% to 24%. So you heard that in our guidance. And we do think bookings and outsourcing, bookings for both, excuse me, revenue for both consulting and outsourcing, both going to be in that range. So we have another strong quarter in consulting and outsourcing revenue growth. And on top of that Tien-Tsin, we do see another strong sales quarter in Q4. And we feel good about both our consulting and our outsourcing pipeline. So hopefully that gave you enough color on where we see bookings and the rest of the year playing out.\nTien Huang: Got it. So balance across the two, which is great. So maybe my quick follow up that everyone's been asking us. So I thought I'd ask you guys, Julie, specifically here maybe for you just how recession ready is Accenture, right? With what the stock market is telling us? How's Accenture different or maybe similarly positioned to what we've seen in past down cycles? Any quick comments on them? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: So I think, Tien-Tsin, so we don't predict the macroeconomic. So what we do is really focused on what has helped us to be successful. And obviously, every financial situation is going to be different to pandemic, we don't know how this is going to be versus what was happening a decade ago. And so let me just focus on why we are in a strong position. And that is, first of all, what's driving today is total enterprise reinvention. And so that means companies are trying to transform using tech data and AI around the enterprise. And we've been investing for a decade to be in the position that were relevant to the enterprise. And so we can do everything as you saw in our examples from HR and finance to manufacturing, right to in the insurance industry, underwriting and claims, right, so and it's really the entire enterprise that we're relevant to, and that'll gives us a huge power to help our clients. And you see that's happening right now with the inflationary environment, you've got consumer goods companies focused very much on cost, as well as growth. And we're able to help them do both, right. And on the other hand, you've got, say the energy companies that have had a really rough cycle, who now have the ability to invest more continuing on their cost discipline, but trying to also drive their transition to clean energy right into advance their digitization. And so our diversity in both what we can do, and our diversity in industries, is extraordinarily helpful. And then as you think about why we're a leader today, I just want to sort of make sure people understand the power of the fact that we can do everything from strategy to consulting, to manage services. So if you just take a consumer goods company, one of the biggest areas of spend is in marketing. We have amazing strategists at Accenture, right. It's a huge group, it's really, really relevant. And what they bring is not simply here, let's go after your marketing spend that looks like the biggest spend, what they can say is, and let me explain to you that the trend is to digitize to use hubs to not be as geographic specific. And let me show you where we've actually executed that and are managing that service for some of the leading companies. That's what our strategists can uniquely bring. And we can talk to our clients and say, and we can either help you build the capability, or we can do it on your behalf because we can access the talent, we can move you more quickly. And so as we think about why are we strong today, and how do we deliver on our enduring shareholder value proposition and growing faster than market delivering large and expansive, returning to shareholders and delivering 360 degree value? It's really based on this unique set of capabilities, these very strong trusted relationships. And then, of course, all of this underpinned by technology, where we're a powerhouse and we are the leading partner of the largest and technology companies in the world. Operator, next question.\nOperator: We will next go to the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll take the attrition one, it looks like attrition after coming down a bit the last couple of quarters re uptick a bit this quarter. Can you just talk about perhaps any color there any underlying dynamics? And how is the attrition environment looking going forward? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, sure, Lisa. I mean, usually we see an uptick in attrition from Q2 to Q3. We actually also see seasonally another uptick in Q4, which we'll expect to see. So this is kind of in line with prior patterns. And again, it's primarily driven by India at the lower end of our pyramid, which is highly competitive. At the same time, we're able to hire for the demand we see. And so, and also, as we've commented before, our overall executive retention, which is the people who are driving our business every day, it continues to be high. So not a lot of change and these are really seasonal upticks.\nLisa Ellis: Okay, got it. And maybe a follow up on that. And then also on Tien-Tsin’s question related to R word, the recession word. What are the types of steps can you just remind us? Like, if you do start to see a slowdown in the business, kind of what are the adjustments that Accenture makes or can make quite quickly to react to changing demand environment, realizing that you're often at the kind of front end of the spear on that, given your strength in consulting in a lot of shorter duration projects.\nJulie Sweet: So, I mean, at the core of our businesses, how we manage supply and demand, right, and so we're, our ability to, we do have high attrition, right? So our ability to not for example, when I say high attrition, meaning our industry has higher, high attrition, and so our ability to not hire to replace that attrition, right. So our core competency is managing supply and demand. And we have an ear to the ground with our clients, but we also have a lot of analytics around what we're seeing in open demand, what we're seeing in our pipeline. So we manage our business with great rigor and discipline, and we'll continue to do that throughout the cycle and of course, I just want to make sure we're not walking past an incredible quarter from revenue and a booking. And as KC said, we see continued strong demand going into the next quarter with another strong bookings quarter and another strong revenue quarter.\nOperator: And next we go to line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to start with a clarification on the full year EPS guidance, it sounds like you're now absorbing an extra $0.29 of headwind, relative to where you were last quarter or the $0.15 from exiting Russia and the $0.14 from incremental FX headwind. Is that accurate?\nKC McClure: So, Jason, that is accurate in that. The $0.15 for Russia. That's absolutely accurate. And then we have an additional $0.14 from the updated from the guidance that we gave you last quarter that we are absorbing. So you're correct.\nJason Kupferberg: Right. So you're still maintaining the lower half of the EPS guidance from last quarter, despite absorbing an extra $0.29. Okay. I just wanted to make, okay.\nKC McClure: That’s right. I mean, I think the key thing that you're asking and the key point, I want to make sure that we are getting across is that there's no change to our business, right, fundamentals and our business performance.\nJason Kupferberg: That's right.\nKC McClure: We actually had a bit of an increase in our revenue guidance, which helps us partially offset the $0.14 drag that we have from FX. So really strong, we continue to see really strong fiscal operations, we just can't absorb completely, all of that large FX movement that we saw from last quarter to this quarter. That's all.\nJason Kupferberg: Of course. And I guess it's encouraging to hear that there doesn't seem to really be much change at all in the demand environment. Obviously, there's been a lot of worry and wonder about that. But can you maybe just talk to us about like nuances of how client conversations have been evolving over the past three months? Any change in clients decision making patterns or clients doing more recession preparation on their end?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. And so, first of all, as always, we call it like we see it. So today, we see strong demand and we're not seeing a change in decision making. What we are seeing is a shift depending and the industry and the market on what clients are asking for it. So for example, in the industry is like a consumer goods industry, you're seeing a lot more focused on costs than a year ago, right, with CEO saying, hey, Julie, I always used to talk to you about growth. Can we talk about growth and cost? Right, you're seeing more investment going into help me do more with less. And at the core of that is Cloud Data AI, you also see a big focus on can we go faster. And I was just meeting with a CEO last week who said, Julie, I just -- can you just look at our strategy? And are we being transformational enough, right? Are we challenging ourselves to go fast enough? And this is where the experience that we have of doing this particularly over the last two years where we saw this compressed transformation is so important. I was just speaking with an energy company last week, where they, like a lot of companies early on when digital transformation started, say, five, six years ago on the front office, they've been doing a bunch of experiments of digital twins around and they're saying to us, okay, Julie, help us understand where we're going to get the most value, but how do we scale and that's the unique combination we have of like, we can understand from a strategic perspective, where's the biggest value, but I can then take like, let me take you this company over here, different industry that's been doing digital twins that we've just been massively scaling over the 18 months, let's share with you the lessons learned on how to do that, because it is the next digital frontier, there isn't as much experience. And now we'll help you go faster. So the context is different depending on the industry. I mean every CEO is of course, focused on the macroeconomic, and people like to use that as a catalyst for doing some of the harder things around cutting costs. And what we do as Accenture because we can help on all aspects of that. We also can embed in a growth conversation. You saw the example we used as big retailer in earnings where we're helping them grow and we're taking out $100 million in costs at the same time, right. And that's what makes us so unique and that's why we will just continue to stay very focused. We're doing a lot in supply chain that those conversations accelerated in Europe for obvious reasons. But they're really it's a global phenomenon. And we're doing a ton here. And of course, as we think about our business, when we look at the demand, we also look at, do we need to upskill anyplace because we're seeing more demand, say in supply chain, or more demand in a particular industry? And that's where the agility of our learning, as you may recall, in the first six months after the pandemic we upskilled 100,000 people to shift to cloud and collaboration technology. So that's how we stay very close. And then we use these other tools, we have like our ability to upskill to make sure that we are responding to what our clients need.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Good quarter, folks. Demand trends still seem strong. I appreciate the qualitative remark on the revenue focus versus cost focus. We already saw take down here in the percent of revenues from consulting as well. I guess the question is around whether you believe that consulting, outsourcing balance might maybe get back down to 50:50 if you anticipate air pocket down the road, because outsourcing work just tends to have longer ramps. Could you to kind of talk through that?\nKC McClure: Yes, sure. Ashwin, happy to and so just in terms, I'll start with the last part first, in terms of just our mix, right, we and I'm not going to guide anything into next year. But if you just look historically, at our mix, it can move around 1% or 2% between consulting and outsourcing. But it's generally been as , three years in the zone of like about 55% consulting and about 45% outsourcing, So that and we're seeing the same this year. So that's the first point. And then in terms of consulting, we are really pleased with our performance to date. And as you know, when we, I gave you some -- I gave guidance for consulting for Q4, but just a reminder, there are book-to-bill is really strong for the year in consulting. And anything is as you know, over one around one book-to-bill consulting, we consider strong, we also look at it over trailing four quarters, right. So but I -- we will give guidance for you in September of -- in September for next year. And that's where we can give you some sense of what the outsourcing is, consulting type of work will be next year. But now, you can look at our patterns and see it's about 55%, 45%.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it, no, thank you for that. I guess the follow up is on M&A. I think you might have mentioned in the past quarter that your M&A spend target this year was closer to $4 billion, it looks like you might not get there. Any color around where valuations easing? What's sort of going on with regards to sort of the strategic approach to M&A? Are you now looking, is that also changing, given the revenue versus cost focus? Or is that just a longer term view? Thought around that would be great.\nKC McClure: Yes, I'll let Julie talk about the strategy. But just to recap what I did say, you're right, we had previously said we thought it would be about $4 billion. We now think it is going, we’ve done $2.2 billion to date, 27 transactions year-to-date. We now think it will be about $2.5 billion. And that's because there's about $ billion, Ashwin, that is going to go into next year because of required regulatory approvals. So that really is the biggest difference between the $2.5 billion and $4 billion that we talked about.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And from a strategic point of view, we continue to believe that the mergers and acquisition, V&A as we call it is critical to the way we grow. And there's three big reasons, right. The first is we will do it for scale. So you saw us do a lot of cloud acquisitions, for example, because we wanted to capture the momentum in the market and to build scale in area, in countries like we did a big one in France, for example, where we didn't have the scale and we had a lot of market momentum. The second reason we do it, is to move into adjacencies. So you saw a spilled Accenture Song and interactive over years, we've used that very effectively with industry X. So you saw that enough big acquisition last year, for example and that continues. And you starting to see that now in sustainability. We just announced three acquisitions. So where we're really built going into new areas with new skills and capabilities and then third, we're always looking to sort of continue to add in our industry and functional expertise and that strategy has served as well. And we continue to believe that that's an important part of our growth going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning and congrats on the results. Wanted to specifically to ask about Europe continues to show robust growth, 30% growth, and I think, KC call that Germany, France, UK, Italy. So lots of concern about the unfortunate situation and war in Ukraine. Is there anything that you guys are seeing that could be in the go forward impacting Europe? Because right now, we're not seeing any weakness in those results.\nJulie Sweet: And we're not seeing any weakness in those results. And so we continue to really stay close to our clients. There's, as I talked a little bit about earlier, there's a shift in focus in many of the more impacted industries, and across the board around things like energy efficiency, right. And so our strengths in, for example, manufacturing and sustainability is helping us drive conversations and helping our clients get more energy efficient, for obvious reasons, given the background in Europe, supply chain, lots going on in supply chain, as you think about what we're doing there, we're doing everything from helping them have greater insight. So we're working with a food retailer, for example, to understand how they can anticipate disruptions better and earlier using data and analytics. So supply chain is a big topic. And then costs because everyone's anticipating, it leads to continuation of the inflationary environment that we're seeing globally. And so cost becomes a big focus. So it's today, again, all roads lead to not just technology data and AI, but how do you use it to transform the business? Which is our sweet spot, right? That is what we do. We partner with the technology companies and our clients to help them use these technologies to get results. And that's what we're doing today. And that's the environment that we're seeing our clients need.\nBryan Keane: Got it, no, that's helpful. And then maybe just as a quick follow up, KC. Any thoughts on the latest on pricing and Accenture’s ability to maintain or even get pricing increases in some different areas where the demand is strongest? Thanks so much and congrats again.\nKC McClure: Okay. Yes, so we were -- we were pleased that we did see, again, improvement, Bryan in our pricing. And again, reminder that pricing, when we talked about pricing, it's the margin on the work that we sold. And we really need to continue to focus on that, which is what we are doing to offset what we're continuing to see in wage inflation in our business, which as we all know is in all industries, it really is across the globe. So and we are seeing some improvement coming from pricing in our P&L. So I'm pleased with that. And at the same time, as you would expect, we're changing the mix of people on our contracts, and also using technology to help offset the impact of wage increases. So again, very focused on pricing. That's the biggest lever that we have but there -- that they all of these improvements together are still lagging the compensation increases. But we're still very, very satisfied.\nOperator: And our next question is from Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Follow through on bookings, any changes in bookings profiles as it relates to contract duration? And are you seeing any uptick in the interest of clients to sell captive operations here? I'm curious if that type of transaction is picked up.\nKC McClure: There really is no change at all in terms of the profile for bookings as it relates to duration.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And I'd say on the captive side, it's more of a steady, kind of, it's been steady. I don't think I'd say picked up or not picked up. It's been steady for the last couple of years.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, and then just a question on Accenture Song. Can you talk about some of the operational changes that have been reported in that business as it relates to the consolidation of agency brands and what that does for you?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. I think a couple of things, I start with the rebranding is really more around reflecting what we’re doing today in Accenture Interactive and that brand was kind of old because it started a decade ago, right where, and it doesn't really reflect kind of the particularly post pandemic, which is really a complete use of technology, bringing in creative using data and AI and moving very, very fast. So this is where you've got examples like we've given in the past, like a Jaguar Land Rover, where they're using managed services to personalize experiences, and they're moving very, very quickly. And so Song just really captures better what, in fact, we are doing there. And from an operational perspective, it's just a natural evolution to bring together some of the brands that we've acquired over the years as you know, we built Accenture Song through a very deliberate, M&A strategy. And so I think it bit more of just kind of the natural evolution.\nAngie Park: Great. And operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Very good. That will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great, thank you very much. And thanks for all the details this morning. Wanted to ask a couple more nuanced questions around Accenture’s operations right now. And first, starting with the bench. How would you characterize your bench right now? Are there pockets of resources that are underutilized versus over utilized? And how much of an operational impact could that be having right now, if any?\nKC McClure: James, thanks for the question. I will just make just focus on the key metrics that we look at. And we report every quarter as it talks about our people and the usage of our people, clients. We're at 91%, which is really in the zone of utilization that we like to be in, it's a little running a little bit hot throughout the past year and a half since pandemic and we're at 91%. So that's a very healthy range that we're good with.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And then a lot of the conversation this morning, obviously is focused on macro and demand, et cetera. But are there any industry groups and/or service dimensions that you're expecting to accelerate versus decelerate, especially as you know the customers seem to be at least modifying a little bit. The conversations they are having to focus a little more on cost versus growth, et cetera. Are there key parts of that -- those different industries and segments that could see changes as a result?\nKC McClure: Maybe I'll just anchor to what we saw this quarter. And I can hand it over to Julie to give a little bit of color on that. But we did see all 13 industries this quarter have double digit revenue growth, right. And when we talked about bookings, we had strength across all of our markets, services and industry.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, and I would just add that, remember, an industry isn't a monolith, right? So you had coming out of the pandemic, in almost every industry, you had some percentage, we've talked about this, who went really fast. Now you've got others who are saying, wait a minute, we're seeing the impact of some of the leaders move faster on their digital transformations. And so for example, those who moved early to the cloud, we're now talking about the next phase of how do you utilize the cloud to drive new things. Remember, our little formula cloud is. The cloud is the foundation, data is the driver and AI is the differentiator. And so if you've moved to the cloud, now, you're using the data in that differently, right, as opposed to those who still need to move to the cloud. Like we are very early in the transition. And so the way we think about it is if you have a total enterprise we walk our clients through, what's the digital core, you need to have? Where are you on the maturity scale? And how do you prioritize? And so while we look at the industries is growing double digits, what's actually happening within the industry really depends on where you are on the maturity curve. And that's what drives our business, right? Because we can help the clients who are leaders go to the next level, and we're helping the ones that are behind trying to leapfrog. And so I think it's important to look at in that sense is that you need to have granular deep understanding of the industries and help our clients. We help our clients with that to know where to go next.\nJames Faucette: All right, thanks for that color. Well, thanks everyone. Great. Thanks James. All right. In closing, we really appreciate everyone for joining us today. And thank you again to all of our people and our leaders for another outstanding quarter in every dimension from our financial results to our 360 degree value beyond our financials. And thank you to all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. We'll work hard every day to continue to earn it all the best.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."},{"symbol":"ACN","quarter":4,"year":2022,"date":"2022-09-22 08:00:00","content":"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Angie Park.

As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2023. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and effect are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Angie, and everyone joining us today. And thank you to our 721,000 people around the globe for delivering a truly extraordinary year. We measure our success by both our financial results and the broader 360-degree value we create for all our stakeholders, our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Strong financial results allow us to deliver more 360-degree value. Let me share a few highlights of this extraordinary year. In FY '22, we delivered record bookings of $72 billion. As our clients continue to execute compressed transformations, we had 100 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million compared to $72 million last fiscal year. We delivered revenues of $62 billion, representing a record 26% growth in local currency, adding $11 billion in revenue for the year. We continue to take significant market share growing more than 2x the market. Our financial results reflect our commitment to creating value for our clients every day, which is why they are turning to us as their trusted partner across the enterprise. We now have 267 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships compared to 229 last fiscal year. We expanded operating margin by 10 basis points and had EPS growth of 22% over adjusted FY '21 EPS, demonstrating our ability to grow profitably and at scale. We achieved this profitable growth while continuing to invest significantly in our business and people with $3.4 billion deployed across 38 acquisitions that are well balanced across markets, services and strategic priorities; $1.1 billion invested in R&D assets, platforms and industry solutions, including growing our portfolio of patents and pending patents to more than 8,300; and $1.1 billion invested in the training and development of our people to grow the skills needed to serve our clients. We continue to offer an employee value proposition that includes providing vibrant career paths and opportunities for our people with approximately 157,000 promotions and over 40 million training hours while expanding our workforce by almost 100,000 and achieving 47% women as we continue our progress towards gender parity by 2025. We believe our unwavering commitment to diversity, broadly defined and inclusion is an essential element of our ability to deliver market-leading financial results because our diversity and inclusiveness makes us smarter, more innovative and more attractive to top talent. We achieved over 85% renewable electricity powering our offices and centers around the world on our way to 100% by 2023. We prioritize creating value around the world and the communities where we work and live, both through investments and job creation and through our direct support of meaningful local initiatives, including our apprenticeship programs in the U.S., UK, Switzerland and Latin America and our growing partnership with Youth Business International, which will help an additional estimated 240,000 young entrepreneurs, ages 18 to 35, build skills and success in a digital future on top of the 370,000 young entrepreneurs already supported through this partnership in many different communities throughout the world. This year, we are proud to achieve our highest brand value and rank to date on BrandZ's prestigious Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list, increasing 28% to over $82 billion and ranking number 26. Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes another outstanding year for Accenture. Once again, our results continue to provide strong validation of our leadership position in the marketplace, the relevance of our services to our clients and our ability to consistently deliver on our shareholder value proposition, including both our financial results and creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. So let me begin by summarizing a few highlights from the quarter across our three financial imperatives. Revenue grew 22.4% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth across all markets, services and industries. We once again extended our leadership position with growth estimated to be more than 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin was 14.7%, an increase of 10 basis points for the quarter. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business. We delivered very strong EPS of $2.60, which represents 18% growth compared to EPS last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.6 billion, driven by superior DSO management. Now let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $18.4 billion for the quarter, our second highest ever with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Outsourcing bookings of $9.9 billion were a record with a book-to-bill of 1.4. We were very pleased with our strong bookings this quarter, which reflects 22% growth in U.S. dollars and 31% growth in local currency, including 26 clients with bookings over $100 million in the quarter. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.4 billion, a 15% increase in U.S. dollars and 22.4% in local currency. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 14% in U.S. dollars and 22% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $7.1 billion, up 16% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our sales dimensions. Technology services grew very strong double digits, operations grew strong double digits and strategy and consulting grew double digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 18% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in public service, software and platforms and consumer goods, retail and travel services. In Europe, revenues grew 26% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in industrial, banking and capital markets and consumer goods, retail and travel services. Looking closer to the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, the UK, Italy and France. In growth markets, we delivered 26% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in banking and capital markets, consumer goods, retail and travel services and public service. From a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 33.3% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.2% compared with 11.3% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 7.1% compared to 7.4% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.7% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with Q4 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 25% for the fourth quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.60 compared with EPS of $2.20 in the fourth quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 43 days compared to 44 days last quarter and 38 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.6 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.8 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $177 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $7.9 billion compared with $8.2 billion at August 31 last year. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.1 million shares for $605 million at an average price of $293.23 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share for a total of $614 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on November 15, a 15% increase over last year. And approved $3 billion of additional share repurchase authority. Now, I would like to take a moment to summarize our outstanding year. We were extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal year '22, greatly exceeding almost all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last September. We delivered $71.7 billion in new bookings, reflecting 21% growth in U.S. dollars, hitting 100 clients with quarterly bookings of $100 million, which positions us well as we begin FY '23. We added significant scale with a record $11 billion in incremental revenue, almost double what we added in fiscal '21. Revenue of $61.6 billion for the year reflects growth of 26% in local currency. Operating margin of 15.2% reflects a 10 basis point expansion over FY '21. We were extremely pleased that we were able to deliver within our original guided range particularly with the continued significant investment in our business and people, including higher wages. Earnings per share were $10.71, reflecting 22% growth over adjusted FY '21 EPS, which is our highest growth in over a decade, reinforcing our ability to grow at scale profitably. As a reminder, we adjusted earnings last year to exclude gains on an investment. Free cash flow of $8.8 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.3. And with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $6.6 billion of cash to shareholders while investing approximately $3.4 billion across 38 acquisitions. In addition to these excellent financial results, let me turn to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. Through our partnership with Save the Children, we are preparing young people for a more sustainable and exclusive future by skilling an estimated 70,000 people to drive social and environmental change. For more information on the 360-degree value we are creating, please go to the Accenture 360-degree value reporting experience, which reflects new information each quarter. So again, FY '22 was a truly extraordinary year and we are now focused on delivering in fiscal '23. And now let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. We succeed by being close to our clients, understanding and anticipating their needs, helping them from strategy to execution with the best solutions for their businesses, whether for growth, cost optimization or both and resilience. And it all starts with technology. With the breadth and depth of our existing capabilities, combined with our incredible learning organization, we are able to pivot as necessary, positioning us to serve our clients' changing needs and capture new market opportunities all while being laser-focused on our own operational excellence. I will give some color on the demand we are seeing. First of all, against the backdrop of the current macroeconomic environment, we delivered $18.4 billion in new bookings in Q4, a year-over-year increase of 31% in local currency. While industries and markets are being affected differently, there are two common themes: all strategies lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security, which are fundamental to its strong digital core. Our cloud business is now $26 billion and grew 48%, with Cloud First being the biggest driver of the growth. Companies are also seeking to execute compressed transformations, the second theme. These mean bold programs on accelerated time frames often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise at the same time. Managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platform and talent, and they are turning to Accenture because of our excellence across the enterprise. We are unmatched in terms of breadth and depth of capabilities and industry coverage. We continue to see a growing number of companies embrace the need to harness the five key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade. Total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the Metaverse Continuum and the ongoing tech revolution, which in turn will fuel our growth. Let me bring this demand to life. First, total enterprise reinvention. We are helping our clients transform every part of their business with technology from building a digital core to optimizing operations to achieve agility, efficiency and resilience to accelerating their growth agendas. While it is still early stages, there are leading companies that have begun systematically transforming multiple parts of their enterprise from moving to the cloud and adopting new ways of working to digitizing manufacturing, to reimagining shared services to creating entirely new business models. Unilever, one of the world's largest consumer goods companies is an example of a company that is leading in total enterprise reinvention. Together, we are setting a new industry standard by reinventing technology delivery with cutting-edge automation, delivering cloud migration at scale, the largest ERP migration to the cloud and the industry and shifting to technology solutions that support their growth strategy. They have changed their business model from a matrix structure to being organized around five distinct business groups. Each business group is fully responsible and accountable for their strategy, growth and profit delivery globally. Now we are helping them build a B2B marketplace that will help millions of small retailers in emerging markets grow their business and create what the Company called shared prosperity. We helped launch in seven markets in just 12 months, implemented a cloud-native, scalable commerce platform powered by data and advanced analytics, and we are managing front-end back-office operations and campaigns delivered in partnership with the Accenture Song team. Because across our industries, we are as relevant to the boardroom to the CFO to the business unit leader to the GM of the factory, and we understand the connections across the enterprise we are uniquely positioned to help our clients as they seek to often simultaneously drive growth, efficiency, cost reduction and increased resilience. For example, we are helping Lupin Limited, a global pharmaceutical company, become an intelligent enterprise by enabling its data-driven transformation journey. A new digital platform will unlock enterprise data to increase efficiencies and decision-makers will now have real-time visibility into integrated data across 100 countries and 15 manufacturing and research facilities. This consolidated view of global business operations and performance will help the Company navigate supply chain disruptions and accelerate product innovation and speed to market while supporting the Company's mission to provide affordable health care to people around the world. We see continued demand for our industry capabilities, which are all about digitizing engineering and manufacturing -- this is the next digital frontier. Industry X revenues grew 38% in FY '22 to total $7 billion. We are helping EDF, a French multinational utility company digitize the construction of a nuclear power station that will provide low carbon energy for more than 6 million U.K. homes. As part of a total enterprise reinvention, our Industry X team transformed EDF digital construction processes by creating a global digital factory model on a secure cloud infrastructure, driving cost efficiency. Construction methods that used to be paper and blueprint based will be digitized and AI will consolidate parts information from millions of pages of supplier guides. Digital dashboards will provide real-time data visibility across all systems and digital twins will help identify areas for automation across power plants, all of which drive safety, efficiency and quality. We are leveraging our expertise of nuclear construction in our cutting-edge cloud, digital and AI capabilities to help EDF deliver on one of the largest capital projects in Europe and accelerate its mission, helping Britain achieve net-zero. And our operation services, now a $9 billion business with 19% growth in FY '22 are fundamental to total enterprise reinvention for our clients because they help our clients digitize faster, access digital talent and reduce cost. For example, we are collaborating with one of the world's largest commercial vehicle manufacturers to develop an independent finance operation, leveraging our deep functional expertise in finance and accounting. With our managed services, we will implement a new platform underpinned by SynOps. Automation, data and analytics will drive and provide real-time decisions while digitizing processes to improve efficiency and user experience, all leading to significant cost reductions, better decision-making and savings. And as our clients build their digital core, security continues to be more important than ever, With over $6 billion in revenue and 45% growth, our integrated security capabilities from identity to threat intelligence to manage security services to incident response are critical as our clients respond to increasing risk as the security landscape widens. We are working with an Asian multinational conglomerate to deliver a comprehensive managed security services, security operations center and holistic security solution to detect, monitor and respond to global security threats 24/7. We will also manage tools to continuously monitor end-user devices to detect and respond to cyber threats, like ransomware and malware and will perform regular threat hunting activities to detect new cyber hacking techniques. This will provide its business units with timely detection and defense against cyber attacks, deliver threat intel for proactive defense, reduce false alarms by 90% and minimize emergency incidents to less than 1% of total incidents. Moving from total enterprise reinvention to the other five forces. Next, talent. Our clients look to us to help them access, create and unlock the potential of talent. We collaborated with Sky, one of Europe's leading media and entertainment companies to modernize its employee experience in human resources operations in the era of hybrid working. By migrating to a Software-as-a-Service multi-platform human capital management solution, all in the cloud, employees will be empowered with anytime, anywhere self-service solutions and access to real-time data and dashboards across all markets in one place. The solution supports all people, management functions from recruiting and onboarding to performance management and learning as well as compensation, benefits and payroll integration. Employees have the full picture of their work experience at their fingertips helping them to build their careers and perform at even higher levels. Now, sustainability. With $1 billion in revenues in FY '22, we continue to believe clients will increasingly need our sustainability services in the decade to come. We collaborated with Swisscom, Switzerland's number one firm for communications, IT and entertainment, on a climate strategy to reduce the Company's emissions and help its customers reduce their emissions by 1 million tons of carbon by 2025 and equal to 2% of Switzerland's total carbon emissions by leveraging technology such as cloud, data, AI, 5G and IoT. These technologies will address faster and higher capacity data transmission with remote management and control of connected devices. We are also helping the Company explore strategies to incorporate technologies within the emerging Scope 4 classification that can help further reduce carbon emissions from customers, allowing Swisscom to positively impact the planet and provide their customers with a larger number of green products and services to choose from. Moving to the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolutions. We continue to invest ahead of our clients' needs and have more than a decade of experience and leadership in metaverse-related capabilities. In fact, we expect to onboard over 150,000 new joiners using Accenture's end floor, and we use our experience and expertise to help our clients as we believe the Metaverse Continuum provides greater possibilities in the wave of digital transformation, and it is still early days. For example, we are helping Tokyo Land Corporation, a Japanese leading leasing, construction and retail real estate company, leverage the metaverse to transform the customer experience through digital twin technology leveraging computer-generated imaging to recreate walk-throughs of its condominiums online to greatly improve its in-person model retour. Customers will be able to visualize the property online, including different home equipment options and the Company will attract more buyers and increase sales while reducing marketing costs and the environmental impact of the construction, operation and removal of the model room. Into the future, we will help create continuous touch points with customers throughout the real estate life cycle and develop new collaborative digital businesses such as purchasing furniture and home appliances and ordering renovation services. And with our continued focus on innovation and the ongoing tech revolution, we continue to invest in our business for the future. For example, in Q4, we invested in Pixel a leader in cutting-edge earth imaging space technology. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately negative 8.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 10% to 14% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 6% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 2.5%. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '23 to be 15.3% to 15.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22. For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.09 to $11.41 or 4% to 7% growth over fiscal '22 results. For the full fiscal '23, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $800 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1. Finally, we expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?\nAngie Park: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep one to question and a follow-up to allow us to as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Good stuff here. Just a question about the outlook for fiscal '23. Can you elaborate a bit further on what underlying macroeconomic outlook that you have embedded in guidance above and beyond the 6 points of FX translation. And maybe the broader question is sort of how, if at all, are you seeing the rising rate environment inflation sort of escalating dynamics of what we've been seeing all year long affecting your business?\nJulie Sweet: Great. Thanks, Lisa. So yes, let me give you a little bit of color around our guidance assumptions. So our revenue range of 8% to 11% for fiscal '23, it includes 2.5% inorganic contribution, and that's compared to about 5% that we did in '22. And that would represent then about 8.5% organic growth at the upper end of our range. And so, we continue to see really strong demand for our services, Lisa. And as you've seen, the most recent estimate for IT Services continues to show the growth for our industry will be about 5%. So anywhere in our range, it will show us continuing to take share. But at the same time, while our growth is not directly correlated with GDP, we read the same things that you do. And the latest GDP estimate for most of the world's largest economies are lower in 2023 than 2022. So again, we're calling for double-digit growth at the top part of our range. Another year of double-digit growth, which would have us adding significant scale, yet again on top of our current $62 billion business.\nJulie Sweet: Maybe I'll add, Lisa, is that -- when we think about the macro environment, what we're really thinking about is what do our clients need, right? So as -- so -- and I talked a little bit about this last quarter, right, is this environment affects different industries differently. So, you've got those who are really tied to the supply chain disruption and the inflation continuing to focus on cost. But you also see that as the uncertainty increases. So over the last 90 to 120 days, you saw changes in the estimates around the GDP growth for 2023, it makes all clients really think about, okay, what's my resilience? Is there more that I can do? Can I take advantage of the environment to push through deeper cost cuts that require you to change behaviors? And so we really think about the environment as what does that mean we need to do to help our clients and how do we continue to pivot. And it's very similar if you think about what we did in the early days of the pandemic, where we've pivoted a lot to, for example, cloud using all of our learning organization. So that's the focus. So it's always an opportunity to better serve our clients.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. Yes. Great color. And then just quick follow-up on bookings, realizing they're obviously always lumpy to quarter-to-quarter and the overall number this quarter was extraordinarily strong, continuing that 1.12 book-to-bill. But is there any -- was it sort of an unusual shift in mix into outsourcing and less consulting? Is there any color or call out there? Or is that just sort of the vagaries of the kind of quarterly fluctuations?\nKC McClure: Sure. And so Lisa, as you mentioned, we feel really good about our bookings in Q4. It was our second highest bookings ever our highest also being this year in the second quarter. What I really liked about it was driven by broad-based demand. So across all markets and our services, and we peel it back. We had good book-to-bill in all dimensions of our business. And with outsourcing a record of almost $10 billion, and that was almost $1.3 billion more than what we did for our last record. And we do continue to see a strong pipeline going into the year, even with those the second best record bookings. But I will say that as we often do, we have seasonally lower bookings in quarter one and we are seeing that again this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just tacking on what Lisa just asked there with this larger book-to-bill in outsourcing relative to consulting. Is the shift to larger deals, does that tell you or should it tell us anything about client priorities? And I'm curious if that changes or even improves your visibility overall for fiscal '23, given you have so much more in the way of larger deals in the backlog.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. I mean I don't -- I mean, obviously, we've got larger deals. You have more visibility around larger deals just because they're larger deals and you see how it is. And certainly, how we think about the business so much, I mean, I think if you just take a -- your underlying question is what are clients focused on, right? And so what we do see is -- and what we actually -- more than just see what we are recommending is that leadership teams remain sort of focused on prioritizing where they can get good time to value, making sure that they are doing things that are material, not having 1,000 different pilots as opposed to actually getting to scale. And so a lot of that does lead to a focus on larger transformation deals, and it's tied to what we call total enterprise reinvention, right? What we're talking to clients about is systematically reinventing. And actually, we've got some research coming out at the end of September that says 68% of CFOs say they today have either three or more transformation programs either going right now or about to start in parallel. And so, what that really does mean that is that you've got more companies do what we've been talking about since the early days of the pandemic, which is systematic transformation. We'll try to do it faster and that does lead to larger programs. And probably the bigger impact for us is less about visibility, but those obviously convert to revenue differently.\nKC McClure: Yes. And maybe Tien-Tsin, I'll just add in terms of -- if you just look at our bookings this year from an outsourcing type of work compared to consulting type of work compared to our history over the last few years, there's really no difference, right? We actually have a slight percentage uptick in what we closed out this year in consulting type of work looking versus outsourcing. So there's no real difference in our mix.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Very good. No, that's really helpful. Just on the -- my follow-up on margins, if you don't mind. Just thinking about investment priorities, organic versus inorganic, I know it's a lower inorganic assumption on growth this year. But -- any update there in terms of the balance? And I'm wondering, I wrote down, I think you said 48% growth in cloud for the year. And I think back to the Cloud First investment you did, I think it was a $3 billion investment. It seems like you got a good return out of that. So, we see more investments like that at this point in the cycle? So yes, just think about organic versus inorganic investing.\nKC McClure: Yes. So, I'll take the inorganic point, and then I'll hand it over to Julie to give some more color. So, first of all, there's no change overall to our capital allocation strategy, right? So, we will continue to use V&A to fuel our organic growth. And so, you'll see the 2.5%, Tien-Tsin, is an inorganic contribution. It's generally in the zone of what we've done in previous years. And so maybe I'll also just take a chance to talk about what that means in terms of how we're going to invest in our business next year and how that relates to how we're seeing our profit because I think it's really important to point out that we're really proud of what we accomplished this past year in '22, where we did 10 basis points of expansion. And Tien-tsin, we were continuing to invest at scale in our business, right? And also in our people, particularly this year with managing wage inflation. So as we look through next year, we expect to continue to invest in our business. We expect wage inflation to continue. It's across all industries and across the globe. And for us, it's going to vary by geography by scale. And we will navigate that like we did this past year with a focus on pricing, which we all know can lag compensation a bit. But I just want to point out that we did see the benefit of improved pricing in our P&L in '22. And so again, we're going to do all of this while changing the mix of people in our contracts, the use of technology to absorb the higher investments that we're making organically and the higher investments that we're making in our people. But -- so it's really important that we continue on our investment profile. And with that, like I'd be really happy next year to land anywhere within the 10 to 30 basis points of op margin expansion. And I would say that based on how we're going to invest throughout the year, there's a bit more potential for us to have a more variability in the quarters as we go throughout fiscal year '23 on our way to 10 to 30 basis points of expansion for the year.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And Tien-Tsin, I just -- Tien-Tsin, I would just emphasize, we believe it is very important to continue to invest at higher levels in our business every year and that's our commitment. And it's been -- we think a big reason for our success is that through every cycle, we continue to invest.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: I wanted to ask to start with on the outlook. In particular, Julie, if there's any comments directional or otherwise, you could give on bookings. I understand you provided the revenue guidance in constant currency, even the backlog runoff of the booking -- tremendous bookings you've given so far, the revenue guidance seems very reasonable, if not a touch conservative. But as you indicated in your prepared remarks, you had record bookings this year. You're facing -- your clients are facing a deeper economic challenge. So, is there any comments you could give whether book-to-bill or the growth rates or any parameters on how we should be thinking about bookings this year? Because it seems like the trajectory there could be different from the revenue growth.\nJulie Sweet: Well, I'll let KC start, and then I'll add on.\nKC McClure: Yes. So Keith, maybe I'll start with a little bit more color on how we actually see revenue kind of breaking out for the year. So from a type of work perspective for the full year '23, we do see consulting revenue growth to be within the context of the 8% to 11% that we gave out overall, which remember has been 6% FX headwind embedded in that. We see consulting revenue to be high single digits to double digits. And outsourcing, we see being double digits. And when you think about what our bookings expectations are, while we don't guide to bookings, you should -- our view remains the same. We look for over a rolling four quarters period of time for book-to-bill to be over one.\nJulie Sweet: Great. And Keith, what I would just say is that -- remember, our focus is helping our clients create value within whatever environment that they are operating in, right? So -- and which is very different depending on your industry. So like pick right now, providers in the U.S., right? They are focused on cost cutting because they went through a tough time with COVID, they're behind in digitization, so they're investing there. And they have to because they're facing one of the most difficult labor markets they've ever had to now sort of resistance and difficulty in automating before. That is a completely different that a global consumer company like Unilever, we talked about in our script, who's reinventing everything that been on this journey for a few years, looking to the next thing, right? And they're dealing with supply chain disruptions, right, cost inputs. And so, that is how we continue to succeed is by understanding the depth of difference in our industry. We're using knowledge that we had from other industry to now accelerate what the providers are doing because they're now implementing SaaS solutions to connect their patients that we've been doing for years in retail, right, and in banking and in lots of other industries. So that our outlook for the year reflects our confidence that we are going to continue to be able to use that knowledge, stay close to our clients and deliver on what they need.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Okay. My follow-up is then focused on free cash flow. The free cash flow guidance is a touch certainly lighter than what we had modeled and I think Street had modeled your margins continue to move higher. So I was just wondering what the puts and takes that you might want to call out with the free cash flow guidance for the year. And then I will see the floor. Many thanks.\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks, Keith. So, as you know, when we set our guidance, we always first start with looking at the ratio. So the ratio that we have in our free cash flow guidance is a very strong $1.1 billion free cash flow to net income ratio. So, we're happy with that. We also are allowing in that guidance a bit of an uptick in DSO from our current level. And then also, we are assuming we are going to have the FX impact of 6% that will obviously impact our free cash flow as well. And as you know, it's not unusual for us to start guidance at the beginning of the year with a free cash flow guidance range, that's below where we delivered the previous year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Obviously, a lot of folks are asking about the macro. So just curious how the macro has changed for you guys over the last three months and how that's influenced your business because it doesn't really show up much in results? So just curious how you would frame that?\nJulie Sweet: Well, as KC said earlier, our guidance for the year takes into account the current estimates for 2023 for GDP, which, as we all know, over the last sort of 90 days have decreased. So, we take that into consideration. And where we see that really affecting our business is our ability to help our clients and think about what to do, right? How do you execute a faster transformation? Are there new opportunities? I'm talking to a consumer goods client now, where we're helping them think about, well, how do we cut marketing and get more effective because they need growth, but marketing is one of the biggest spend areas for a consumer goods company. And by the way, let's not waste a good environment to be able to catalyze cultural and behavioral change as they think about things. So that's where we are seeing it. And otherwise, our guidance reflects -- as you know, it's not a one for one, but we obviously take into account the economic environment.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Yes. Yes, I was just looking at Europe, in particular, up 26% in local currency, given all the concerns around Europe. It's just a pretty amazing number. It doesn't seem to have come off much from the growth rates you've been putting up.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. We're very proud of our European team because they are really close to our clients.\nKC McClure: Yes. And maybe, Brett, I'll give you a little bit of color on that as it relates to Q1. Let me give you a peel back a little bit on the revenue outlook that we have for the first quarter -- and when we look at the markets, we see all the markets for the first quarter within that 10% to 14% revenue range that we gave. They all have the potential to be double digits, and that includes Europe. And then also for the consulting type of work in Q1, we see a high single-digit to low double-digit growth range within that 10 to 14. And I would peel back consulting a little bit for you, too. Within consulting, we see the detect portion of consulting the systems integration, we'll have continued strong demand and S&C, we expect to be in lower single digits.\nBryan Keane: No, that's really helpful and then just a quick follow-up, just thinking on KC on visibility. How has visibility changed at all, if at all, for Accenture? When you look out further on in the quarters as we get to Q4, it's obviously almost 12 months away, so it's probably a little bit hard to figure out exactly the right growth rates, but just thinking about the visibility of the business.\nKC McClure: I would say, Brian, that in terms of looking at the back half of the year, I mean, that's no different than the way it is, honestly, every year. We talked a lot about what we just mentioned on how we look at the macro in the market. But the back half of the year, we always -- it's always less certain at this time of the year than obviously the first quarter and the first half. Again, it's no different than what we have experienced every year.\nJulie Sweet: And as always, clients still -- most of our clients are calendar year, and they'll set their budgets, and we'll know more about that in January. So it's really the same.\nKC McClure: It is. It is.\nBryan Keane: Got it, great. Congrats on the results.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nKC McClure: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Appreciate all the commentary today as usual. Looking at kind of the supply and kind of how you're managing your own employees, et cetera, how does the shift in client priorities manifest itself in where and how your services are being delivered? And how is that influencing your talent strategy right now around pace of hiring, where you hire, et cetera?\nJulie Sweet: Well, as you know, our -- we have a very deep competency in supply and demand. And actually, over the course of the last couple of years, we continue to innovate. We have an incredible what we call integrated talent control tower that is able to predict earlier and earlier in our sales cycle, where the skills will be needed and what type of skills. And so for us, this is just normal business, right? And keep in mind, technology demand is really incredible, right? I mean you saw that in our results. All strategies lead to technology. And we're super pleased with not only our performance there, but what we're seeing ahead as clients continue to build the digital core as fundamental to all of their other strategic needs. And our talent supply chain is able to see that, predict it, understand the skills and keep moving forward.\nJames Faucette: That's great. And then turning to pricing, just wondering what the tone and tenor of pricing conversations have been? How those have progressed. And how are you building in? Or how should we think about what's being built into your formulation of outlook around magnitude of potential uplift to revenue from pricing versus margins, et cetera?\nKC McClure: So let me just remind you that when I'm talking about pricing in my answer, I'm talking about the margin on the work that we've sold. And I'm really pleased that we've continued to see improvements in pricing. And we are seeing the benefits. I mentioned this earlier, but I'll just repeat it. We are seeing the benefits come through in our P&L. And we continue to focus on improvements in pricing as we enter into fiscal year '23. So I'm really I'm really pleased with the progress we've made.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: KC, I just wanted to pick up on your comment on one of the prior questions around -- I think you said strategy and consulting, up in the low single-digit range in Q1. So Curious if that's the same kind of range you anticipate for the full year fiscal '23? And is that below corporate average level, just reflective of the more kind of discretionary nature and growth-oriented nature of those services?\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks, Jason. In terms of Q1, it's really just a few simple things. One, we got a tough compare. Two, is there's less -- when I mentioned less inorganic that really does also hit in essence in the S&C part. And then as Julie talked about, a lot of our S&C practitioners are really focused on some -- a lot of the larger transformational deals. And that just has Jason, a different revenue yield, and it bleeds in later throughout the year.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. Maybe just turning to the supply side for a second. It looks like attrition was unchanged in Q4 versus Q3. And wondering what you're expecting there in fiscal '23 as well as what you're expecting for wage inflation relative to 2022 and whether or not some of the broader layoffs across other parts of the tech industry, is that taking some of the pressure off some of your supply metrics at all?\nKC McClure: Yes. So I'll start, Jason, with the last part. I mean we had -- I'm really pleased with the way we were able to grow at scale profitably while managing the wage inflation in FY '22. And as we said a little bit earlier, but just to repeat, we do expect wage inflation to continue, and we have factored that into our guidance.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And look, I would just say to you that technology skills are in demand by both companies as well as our competitors because technology is at the core of strategy. And so, we're expecting to have a continued tight labor market, and we continue to expect us to really excel because despite that market, as you know, even this last year, we added 100,000 people. So, I don't -- the fact that there has been some layoffs in certain markets isn't really, I think, going to change much.\nAngie Park: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And that question will come from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: I wanted to start on the growth outlook. Can you just give us a sense on how you're thinking about the second half trajectory just in the fiscal '23 range, just given a significant uncertainty? Just curious how you went about building that second half forecast. And then just within the year, are you expecting the strategic priorities to hold the double-digit growth? So across Song and Cloud First and Next or are any of those a little bit more exposed to potential slowdown and uncertainty?\nKC McClure: Yes. So, I'll maybe just start with the overall outlook that we have read. You can see that we started with 8 to 11. I already gave the color on that. So -- and within that, obviously, we have a strong start at 10% to 14% growth. And in terms of really what that looks like for the rest of the year, I mean we'll continue to give guidance like we typically do as we progress through FY '23. I mean, as Julie mentioned, we see continued strong demand in our technology -- our areas of technology. And other than that, we don't really give any more guidance and kind of view on revenue outlook than what I've already shared.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And just -- I think it's always important that we are continuously thinking about both the near term, this fiscal year and the longer term and anchoring on the five forces of change for the next decade. And so, total enterprise reinvention, talent we talked about the investments we're making in sustainability. We just made a great acquisition that's on Carbon Intelligence, which is all about consulting around carbon getting to net-zero strategies. The Metaverse Continuum, small today. We're the leading enterprise user our own way of onboarding, but lots and lots of interest, and we're already making those investments and then the ongoing tech revolution. And so that's why as you think about our results, right, we are investing today and tomorrow and really are looking at the demand that we see over the next decade.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Okay. And then it looks like just on M&A, it looks like you did close on more in 4Q than you had initially anticipated. So how should we think about the planned spend in fiscal '23 for M&A underlying the 2.5% growth contribution? And then just how do you start off the year in 1Q? What's the inorganic assumption in that outlook?\nKC McClure: Yes, sure. So you're right, we did end up spending $3.4 billion for the year in '22 because we were able to get some of the regulatory approvals done this last fiscal year '22 that we weren't sure of the timing. And you'll see that because of that, while we're going to continue to always provide the inorganic outlook on a full year basis. So, that 2.5% is a full year. We're not -- we don't really do that by quarter because that again can also be lumpy. We're not going to continue to provide the capital allocation amount as we go into '23, just because it can really vary by the end of the year, and we'll be able to -- you'll be able to see it and we'll report it every quarter.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, it's probably worth reminding that last Q1, we had Umlaut and Novetta, which were both very large acquisitions come in, in Q1. So probably just good to remind everyone that's part of what's driving the Q1 S&C results too. Great. So before we wrap up, I do want to mention that Angie Park, who has been our Head of Investor Relations for the past six years, has been promoted to become the CFO for our really outstanding technology services business. Angie has been an absolutely incredible Head of IR and we're particularly grateful for how she has helped lead us through some of the most turbulent times in the history of Accenture. I know from speaking to our investors and analysts how much they've appreciated Angie's steady hand, her commitment to transparency and connection. And I know we'll all miss her in this role, but are extremely excited to see her start the next chapter of what has already been an incredible career. So thank you very much, Angie. And I am also pleased to welcome Katy O'Connor who will become our new Head of Investor Relations. She's got incredible experience. She's held many finance roles during her 25 years at Accenture. So please join me in welcoming Katy and I know she's looking forward to getting to know all of you in the days ahead. In closing, I do want to thank again all of our people and our managing directors for what you're doing every day. Our people, our actions and our results in FY '22 have positioned us to be very strongly going into FY '23 and create even more 360-degree value. And finally and very importantly, thank you to all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Welcome to the Accenture's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Katie O'Conor. Please go ahead.\nKatie O'Conor: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you'll hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning, before KC provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2023. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you to everyone joining us today and especially to our people around the world for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in delivering another strong quarter of financial results and the broader 360-degree value we continue to create for all our stakeholders, our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities. Let me share a few highlights of this 360-degree value and our continued disciplined execution. We delivered strong bookings of $16.2 billion, with 24 clients with quarterly new bookings over $100 million, demonstrating our clients’ continued commitment to transformation and our ability to understand and anticipate our clients' needs, whether for growth, cost optimization or resilience and our ability to deliver compressed transformations. We delivered revenues of $15.7 billion, representing 15% revenue growth in local currency, with double-digit growth in each market. We estimate that we are growing more than 2x the market, while delivering margin expansion of 20 basis points. We continue to invest in our people, with 10.4 million training hours this quarter, representing an average of 15 hours per person, providing learning opportunities and upscaling to enable us to pivot as our clients' needs evolve. We earned the number one position on the Refinitiv Diversity and Inclusion Index for the third time in the past five years and a top score on the Workplace Pride Global Benchmark, recognizing Accenture as the leader in our industry. We believe our unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion is both the right thing to do and an essential element of our business strategy and strong financial performance. We have reached 97% renewable electricity, closing in on our goal of 100% by the end of 2023. Our own progress in sustainability is important to our ability to lead in helping our clients harness this key force of change and in attracting top talent. Finally, I want to congratulate our more than 1,200 new promotes to Managing Director, 119 new appointments to Senior Managing Director and the more than 90,000 people we promoted around the world in Q1 overall, reflecting our commitment to providing vibrant career paths. Over to you KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were pleased with our overall results in the first quarter, where we continue to drive growth across markets, services and industries to extend our leadership position in the market. We ran our business with rigor and discipline and expanded operating margin while investing at scale, and we continue to deliver on our shareholder value proposition to both our financial results and by creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. Let me begin by summarizing a few key highlights across our three financial imperatives from the quarter. Revenues grew 15% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of about 9.5% compared to the 8.5% provided in our business outlook last quarter. Adjusted for the actual foreign exchange impact in the quarter, we were approximately $150 million above our guided range with double-digit growth across all of our markets and industry groups, with 10 of the 13 industries growing double digits and three high single digits. We continue to take market share with growth estimated to be more than 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Operating margin was 16.5% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our people and our business, including acquisitions. We delivered very strong EPS of $3.08, up 11%, while absorbing a substantial FX headwind. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $397 million and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $686 million in acquisitions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $16.2 billion for the quarter with a book-to-bill of one and growth of 6% in local currency. Consulting bookings were $8.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of one. Managed Services bookings, which we formally refer to as Outsourcing, were $8.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition, we continue to see improved pricing on our new bookings, which refer to contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.7 billion, a 5% increase in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, up 1% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $7.3 billion, up 11% in U.S. dollars and 20% local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, Technology services grew strong double digits, Operations grew double digits and, as expected, Strategy & Consulting grew low single digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 11% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Public Service, consumer Retail and Travel Services, Industrial and Health. In Europe, revenues grew 17% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and high single-digit growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Looking closer to the countries, Europe was driven by double-digit growth in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 19% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service, and Chemicals & Natural Resources. From a country perspective, gross markets was led by double-digit growth in Japan. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9%, consistent with the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.8% compared with 9.7% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.6% compared to 6.9% for the same quarter last year. Operating income was $2.6 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.5% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with Q1 last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% compared with an effective tax rate of 24.4% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.08 compared with diluted EPS of $2.78 in the first quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 48 days compared to 43 days last quarter and 42 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $397 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $495 million net of property and equipment additions of $99 million. Our cash balance at November 30 was $5.9 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 5.2 million shares for $1.4 billion at an average price of $272.3 per share. At November 30, we had approximately $4.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $706 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on February 15, a 15% increase over last year. Finally, turning to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. We are extremely proud to be recognized as one of the seven company all stars on the Wall Street Journal Management Top 250 List for Excellence in customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength, and we also received the top score for social responsibility overall. In summary, we were pleased with our results in the first quarter, and we're off to a strong start for the year. And now let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, KC. We remain laser-focused on staying close to our clients, advising them how to navigate the macro, providing the right solutions to enable compressed transformations and adjusting to their changing needs. Let me give some further color on what we're seeing in the market and how we see the demand environment shaping up. Over the last quarter, as we can all read, the economic estimates for 2023 continue to decline. While the latest industry estimates for 2023's technology spending continue to show robust growth of 5% or so, we will see how the market evolves as clients finalize 2023 budgets. So what does today's market mean for our clients? We believe that the current macro is making it even clearer to clients that they need to change more, not less, and that two of the five key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade: the need for total enterprise reinvention enabled by tech data and AI; and the ability to access, create and unlock the potential of talent, are critical to succeed in the near, medium and long term. We see this continuing across industries and markets with two common themes. First, all strategies continue to lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. And second, companies remain focused on executing compressed transformation to achieve lower costs, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster. What does this mean for Accenture? Our strategy positions us for continued industry leadership because we have a unique set of strengths that our clients need to navigate today and succeed tomorrow. We are able to do so because of our deep strategy and consulting expertise across industries, allowing us to be a trusted adviser during different economic cycles as we bring the expertise, coupled with the real-life practical experience they need. Our ability to help clients achieve total enterprise reinvention through our depth across the enterprise, from the frontline to core operations to corporate functions, as well as our ability to advise our clients shape and deliver value-led transformations, and through our breadth of services, from strategy and consulting to our strategic managed services, which help clients digitize faster, access talent and lower costs. And our global footprint allows us to act at scale and with speed. Together, this positions us as the compressed transformation partner of choice, as you can see, and yet another strong quarter of clients who selected us for work of more than $100 million this quarter. I am pleased to see how quickly we are pivoting to meet the evolving needs of our clients. We have seen a higher level of sales and pipeline coming from cost-focused initiatives, often also including growth or capability enhancements. We are leveraging our breadth of services, deep-client and ecosystem relationships and industry and functional expertise to help our clients and Accenture shift to the highest value opportunities. Our track record of delivery at speed and scale over many years with clients -- remember, 99 of our top 100 clients have been with us for over 10 years, this gives our clients confidence that by partnering with us, they will deliver on their commitments. Investments in our assets and solutions such as myWizard and SynOps, which underlie both strategy and consulting, technology and operations managed services, as well as our delivery of compressed transformation, enables us to differentiate with our insights and services. Our ability to invest in acquisitions helps us to expand our relevance across the enterprise from building a digital core with Sentia and Albert, to optimizing upper duration to achieve agility, efficiency and resilience with Pilatus, to accelerating their growth agendas with RAMP, and our substantial investment in the skills of our people allows us to pivot to new areas of demand to be an attractive destination for top talent. Now let's turn to the quarter. To bring to life this demand environment across the five key forces of change for our clients: total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolution, which in turn drag our growth. First, total enterprise reinvention, we continue to help our clients achieve a new performance frontier by building their digital core, optimizing operations and accelerating growth, leveraging cloud, data and AI and new ways of working. We are helping Roche, a Swiss multinational health care company specializing in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, with a total enterprise reinvention, building a digital infrastructure to match changing business needs. Using data integration, we have changed the way tumor boards are organized and conducted, empowering counter teams to be more efficient and effective in determining next steps for cancer care. And we have built a digital ecosystem that will create innovative products and solutions to drive diabetes care. Now as part of one of the largest ERP modernizations in the world, we are working together to deploy a digital backbone that will unify and harmonize nearly 700 business processes for more than 100,000 end users. The integrated platform will simplify the system landscape and connect activities across the value chain from R&D and manufacturing to patient treatment. Cloud, a $26 billion business in FY '22 grew 48%, with even stronger growth in Cloud First and continues to grow very strong double digits. In fact, we believe that the cloud continuum will become the new operative system for the future enterprise. Migrating to the cloud to drive efficiencies is just the first step. As we anticipated with our Cloud First strategy and investments, we are seeing our clients make significant investments to modernize, improve and innovate in the cloud, leveraging data and AI to drive new business value. For example, Accenture Federal Services is partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a U.S. federal agency under the Department of Health and Human Services, to accelerate its migration to the cloud across the enterprise and modernize its IT portfolio. Through this work, we will also help to achieve CDC's mission to protect people from health, safety and security threats by supporting the development of integrated, real-time public health data and surveillance systems. As our clients build their digital core, security continues to be more important than ever, as reflected in our very strong double-digit growth in Q1. We are expanding our cybersecurity footprint for a large health care network in Brazil to elevate their cybersecurity posture to a new hot level of preparedness. We are growing the organization's security profile with a cyber as a service solution that will enhance the cyber readiness of their infrastructure and operations. This new project not only consolidates the work that up to four different providers typically do, it also is the largest cybersecurity contract ever signed in Brazil by any provider. High demand for our strategic Managed Services, reflecting $7.3 billion in revenue and 20% growth in the quarter, demonstrates the importance of these services to our client strategies as it enables clients to move faster, leveraging our digital platform's expertise and talent. Our Managed Services are differentiated by our ability to bring in our deep expertise from across the enterprise, including Song, which grew double digits in the first quarter. For example, we're expanding our partnership with Allianz, an Italian and main bank of Allianz Group, to continue the bank's digital transformation with a new platform in the cloud, a modern IT architecture and a new operating model. Our Song team is helping to create a new customer mobile app to improve customer experience. And our end-to-end managed services capabilities, tailored to the financial services industry, will help the bank grow and scale its position in the market, ensure regulatory compliance and lower total cost of ownership. We continue to see strong demand for our industry edge capabilities, digitizing engineering and manufacturing, which we see as the next digital frontier with continued very strong double-digit growth in Q1. We are helping Celanese, a global chemical and specialty materials company on their digital transformation journey that will increase their manufacturing production resiliency, productivity and predictability of plant operations. We're teaming with ecosystem partners to design and implement a scalable digital twin platform at one of their largest manufacturing facilities, which plans to increase revenues through increased plant output, reduce costs through improved productivity, product quality and equipment reliability and improve overall safety in the workplace. We also are supporting an enterprise cloud transformation to provide a scalable platform for future enterprise growth and innovation. Next, talent. Our clients continue to look to us to access, create and unlocked talent as a critical element of their transformation. We're helping a global chemical manufacturer with an end-to-end IT transformation as part of their multiyear digital journey. The Company faces increasing IT costs, aging assets and tools and overreliance on contractors. We're implementing a full Managed Services model that will help modernize its IT, and this digital transformation includes a talent transformation. Together, we will upskill their people and data cloud and AI through our Accenture Academy so that everyone grows together, helping the Company leapfrog its competitors with innovative industry-leading solutions. Now, sustainability. We continue to prioritize embedding sustainability into our clients' digital transformation and on providing a direct sustainability service. For example, we are expanding our partnership with the European Multinational Aerospace Corporation to help improve their environmental and social impact across the enterprise. In recent years, we have worked together to digitize the Company's supply chain and manufacturing operations using a digital twin to improve productivity and reduce waste. Now we are working together to advance their sustainability agenda. We're supporting their aviation decarbonization road map, from accelerating the use of sustainable aviation fuel to helping design low-emissions aircraft. We are finding new ways to help make the supply chain more transparent and ethical, helping the Company replace hazardous materials from the product life cycle with safer, greener alternatives. And we are outlining a strategy to help them meet its net zero targets and internally foster a culture that is focused on sustainability. Finally, the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolution. While still in the early innings, we believe the metaverse will not only change how people work, but it will also profoundly change every part of every business, from how we interact with customers, what products and services they offer, how they are made and distributed, how you engage with your people from employee onboarding to personal productivity. We're partnering with NTT DOCOMO, a Japanese mobile operator to speed up the adoption of Web3, a new blockchain-based version of the Internet that promises a digital economy with greater social impact. We will develop and grow a secure technology platform for Web3, which will enable new products, services and community building. Training will ensure that Web3 engineers and business leaders collaborate with organizations effectively and securely on the platform. NTT DoCoMo's work on societal issues will now expand with the use of Web3, helping companies and governments transform social infrastructures and provide solutions that would improve people's lives. We continue to invest ahead of our clients' teams to the future, with a keen focus on innovation and the ongoing tech revolution. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Turning now to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 6% to 10% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 5% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we continue to expect our revenue to be in the range of 8% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which continue to assume an inorganic contribution of about 2.5%. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal '23 to be 15.3% to 15.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. I mentioned last quarter, we may see more variability in quarters as we go throughout fiscal year '23, and that's playing out as we expected, with contraction in the second quarter expected and potentially overall for H1. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22. For earnings per share, based on the change to FX, we now expect our full year diluted EPS for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.52 or 5% to 8% growth over fiscal '22 results. Full fiscal '23, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $800 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1%. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. And with that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep one to question and a follow-up to allow us to as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Happy holidays. Really good results, strong results here. The one area that was a little softer was the Strategy & Consulting area, and I think you guys called that out as expected. Just thinking about Strategy & Consulting that you knew it was going to be a little bit softer, and it's becoming a little bit softer. Is that just more the move towards the cost agenda versus growth and just thinking about what we can expect there going forward?\nKC McClure: Hi, Bryan, thanks for the question. As you mentioned, our Strategy & Consulting results for Q1, they did come in as expected. But let's talk about what we're seeing go forward. And we do see a slight decline in Strategy & Consulting for Q2 before we're going to reconnect with growth in H2. And why is that for Q2? It's really a couple of things. We do see that we are going to have some impact from less revenue from smaller deals that which Julie will talk a little bit about here. And second, we do continue to see our S&C practitioners focus on high impact transformational deals, and they're going to bleed into revenue a little bit later in the year. There's a really important to our clients, but the revenue conversions at a slower pace.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Bryan, maybe -- I want to maybe say -- to make sort of two points. So first of all, specifically on S&C, I think it's important to understand we really have a tale of two worlds. So our S&C work is growing high single-digit to low double-digit when it's tied to areas around cloud, enterprise and industry platforms, talent, cost reduction, everything tied to building to the core. So underneath our results, like that's growing great. The other world, right, is S&C that's tied to things like ad spend, creative marketing strategy and campaigns and other sort of front-office initiatives are contracting, right? And that's, of course, the strength of Accenture, is that we've got a very broad range of services even within the Strategy & Consulting as well as a broad range of industries. And so while the -- at the top line, you saw it 3% this quarter, there'll be a slight decline next quarter, underneath that, you've got a lot of strength in everything that's really driving our results. And I think that's really important to just understand. But then, I want to take a step back and just maybe comment on the demand environment. KC just mentioned kind of the impact in S&C and smaller deals. So first of all, like we're obviously super pleased with Q1, right? Great growth, and we're really happy with how we're seeing the year start. Now at the same time, what do we see over the last 90 days, what we saw what everybody saw, right, which was the macros continue to have uncertainty and you've got GDP estimates declining over the past 90 days. And on the one hand, our clients clearly are remaining ambitious, right, they're committed to revamping their business. And you see that in the 24 clients with quarterly new bookings over $100 million, right, which is an increase over this time last year. At the same time, they're more and more focused on cost and resilience. And many are having to make pretty hard choices, right, because the macro affects the industries differently. So you've got some industries, retail consumer goods, that are much more challenged than say, energy. But at the same time, and we talked about starting to see this last quarter, kind of regardless of industry, as the macro uncertainty has increased, right, they're being a little bit more cautious. So we're seeing some delays in decision-making. We see changes in the pace of spending, and we're seeing some pausing of the smaller deals. And all of this impacts the smaller deals more than the bigger deals because we're continuing to see that big transformation focus. So that impacts our revenue and profit build over the year, which is part of what we're seeing in S&C in the second quarter with the decline. And then, I just want to remind everyone that this is exactly the environment that you see the strength of Accenture. It is because we are so broadly diverse. I mean you saw it in the examples in my script, all around the world, all around industries. But who else could be in Asia doing border security, in the U.S., working with the state of Missouri on a talent and tech implementation; in Europe, working with a European grocer doing IT modernization, cost reduction and customer experience? Just moving around the world, you're back into Asia, working with a telecom operator, digitizing their platform, creating a new customer experience. And so, you just continue to see that our strategy that we've had for decades to be across industries, a global footprint and depth and breadth of services. I mean Managed Services is on fire because we could digitize faster, get that compressed transformation, help them access the talent and lower cost. So back to you, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Just to – and good morning. I just add to the Bryan's last question here, just as on the visibility side, especially in consulting relative to Managed Services. And given, Julie, what you just said there, any change in your thinking on mix of growth across Consulting versus Managed Services, asking for both, I guess, bookings as well as revenue here?\nKC McClure: Yes. I'll take – Hey, Tien-Tsin. I'll take the -- in terms of the outlook for how we see growth going by our various – by our two types of work. So for the full year, at the top end of our range, we see Consulting high single digits, and we see Managed Services continue to grow double digits. And as it relates to outlook and bookings, what we're seeing is that we do have a strong pipeline and we actually see continued strong pricing in that pipeline. And we do see that we will have a solid bookings quarter in Q2, and that includes Consulting. It's likely -- it will likely be lower though than the record bookings in Consulting that we had last quarter, and we expect to continue to see really strong bookings in Managed Services.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, and we're going to continue to focus our Strategy & Consulting expertise on these platform and cloud-led transformation.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Gotcha. Okay. Perfect. Then a quick follow, if you don't mind. I heard the pricing favorable utilization looks like it's steady attrition nicely, better or lower, 13%, I think I saw on the sheet there. So just same question on visibility with respect to cost and margin, if you're flexing or changing anything here, I know the range overall is the same, but it feels like you've got a good line of sight in terms of your costs. I just wanted to confirm that.\nKC McClure: Yes. Sure. So I'll talk a little bit about on the attrition point, and then we can get into kind of what we're seeing overall in our cost and our visibility in that regard. So attrition was down to 13%, and I think all of you know, but there's a structural pattern of attrition that typically comes down from Q4 to Q1. This year came down at a tick more, and we're really pleased with that. And that means we have to hire fewer replacement people, it means less recruiting costs, and you saw that in our improvement in G&A this quarter, and it's less ramp up for new hires. And so Tien-Tsin, in terms of visibility of what we see, I mean, we expect to continue to hire for the specific skills that we need. With upskilling, we may not need to hire as many people as we go throughout the year. But we have a very deep -- and we have a very deep competency in our supply and demand balancing and we're always focused on. And in terms of profit, let me talk a little bit about what we're seeing in operating margin. So operating margin, we're pleased with the 20 basis point expansion that we have in Q1 and really pleased to be confirming our 10 to 30 basis points expansion for the year. And as I said last quarter, we'd be pleased to land anywhere within the 10 to 30 basis point range. But let me give you a little bit more color about what we're seeing in Q2 and then just the visibility, as you ask, about the rest of the year. So I mentioned last quarter, we may see more variability in the quarters as we get through fiscal '23. And as I mentioned in the script, that is exactly playing out. Now, there's a few reasons for that. So in Q2 overall, the first thing, and I think all of you know, it's a structurally lower profit quarter just to begin with, in part because of the holidays. As well as for us, it's when most of our compensation increases kick in. So while we've planned for those comp increases, it does take some time to work through our P&L. And then in addition, in Q2, the impact of the changes of smaller deal volumes that Julie described, it's going to impact Q2 revenue. And that -- when you take everything into consideration, that's why we expect the Q2 operating margin decline in Q2 and potentially for the first half of the year. And so with that, then the math shows that most of our margin expansion will be in the back half of the year. And how -- why is it that we see that? We have a strong pipeline, as I mentioned. We have continued strong pricing improvements in our pipeline. And as always, we have some simple, but important levers on how we run our business. We are going to in addition to pricing, focused on cost efficiencies and delivery efficiencies within how we run our contracts. We're going to manage supply and demand, as we always do, with even more rigor and discipline. And we're going to continue to work on digitizing and cost-effective running the operations of Accenture.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: I wanted to ask, Julie, a bit about the progress on compressed transformations. I think you started using that phrase about two years ago sort of in the earlier days of the pandemic. And now as you're working with clients looking out into 2023, can you just give some color on sort of like how far they are along in the compressed transformation? Is this -- do we -- are we still only in the third or fourth inning? Or a lot of your clients sort of in full rollout mode and we've got a couple of years left? Just trying to get a sense for sort of that big push we've seen, how far through the process are we? How much of this sort of sustained growth can we expect going forward?\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Lisa. It's a great question. And there's a couple of ways that you look at it. So what we saw particularly in the early days was that leaders before the pandemic kind of we're doubling down and becoming more ambitious. And from that time, you've got more and more companies then looking to see their competitors and sort of being pushed to themselves being more ambitious. And so, I think I shared last quarter that we got some recent research that said something like 68% of CFOs we surveyed are working in companies that have three or more transformation programs in progress in parallel. That being said, it's still very much the early days because we're so early in building the digital core that's enabling these transformations. So while we've had a big acceleration on the migration to the cloud, it's still kind of early innings, 35% or so. And most of the companies report, that although the -- when they get to the cloud they haven't actually been able to access the services and get the value yet, and that's why you're continuing just to see this drive in our cloud business, particularly Cloud First, because we continue to do all the migration work. And then those we've migrated are now coming to us and say, \"Hey, look, we sign these big consumption contracts. We're trying to figure out how to transform our business and we don't know how to.\" So you basically got people who have moved fast, have lots more to do, and that's this concept of total enterprise reinvention. And then you have many companies that are just starting to really take on these more ambitious programs. So, we see this as a decade of transformation.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. Good. Then a quick one on M&A. I think you highlighted, KC, about close to $700 million in this past quarter in M&A. Can you guys just give a little more color on what you're seeing in the environment? Have you seen some of the private valuations come in? And are you seeing sort of an uptick in activity in that space?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. I mean great companies never come at cheap prices, is what I would say. So -- and we really try to focus on buying highly valued companies. So we really aren't seeing that. The broader environment, yes, but where we're focusing, we're not really seeing any big differences. And we think that's the right answer, right, we want to buy great companies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koning: And I guess my question, I've noticed your -- the strategic priorities continue to grow significantly. And they grew at the same pace, at least the qualitative like numbers you wrote were at the same pace as last quarter. Is that -- I mean, is that like very close to, I guess, the same growth? Like did it decelerate at all? Or is that actually very similar? And what percent of revenues are those? Just I'm kind of thinking through the rest of the business must have decelerated a little more of that.\nKC McClure: Yes. So, overall -- let me say first, Happy Holidays. It's good to talk to you. In terms of overall, our strategic priorities, as you mentioned, and you're right, you would expect in a quarter where we grew 15%, we did have higher growth overall in terms of what we have in our strategic priorities. They would -- in total, they did grow at a faster pace than the rest of Accenture at 15%, which is the intent overall of our strategic priority. And so -- which does account for the majority of our revenue.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Look, as you go forward, we talked a little bit about earlier, you've got parts of our business like some of the customer focus ad spending and marketing that's -- where clients are more challenged to be able to prioritize those areas, you also see some changing in industry. So, we're all reading about comms, media and tech, right? So, we are going to see -- we expect kind of a slowdown in spending from those clients as they reposition and think about sort of their -- what the changes they need to make, and we're helping them do that. So again, the diversity of our business really helps us balance. You do have, at any given time in an environment like this, areas that -- where the clients are having to make different choices and we're trying to pivot to help them and be really relevant to their current needs. And that's why it was so important to see the -- we've been talking about this for a couple of quarters, the importance of cost and to see that really coming through in our sales and pipeline, just demonstrates how our breadth of services allows us to pivot to the needs of our clients.\nDavid Koning: Yes. Got you. And just one quick follow-up. You mentioned in Consulting, I think Tien-Tsin asked, you mentioned in Consulting, I think, bookings being down. Was that sequentially or year-over-year? And is that on a constant currency basis?\nKC McClure: Yes. So just first of all, bookings overall in terms -- let's just talk about bookings overall, Dave. They were up in local currency by 6%. But when you take the FX headwind, they were down overall in U.S. dollars. And what I mentioned was -- we expect a strong bookings quarter in Q2. The question that Tien-Tsin had was about the Consulting bookings expectation for Q2, and we expect a strong bookings in Q2. I just want to remind you that that's where we -- that was also the quarter though, last year, where we had our record Consulting bookings last year of about $11 billion. And so I just wanted to set the expectation that will be strong, it may not surpass the $11 billion that we did last quarter, last year in Q2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Just wanted to follow up on the D&A question, and I completely get the point around valuations and wanting to look at the best companies. But are there any specific capabilities we should think about that you would be targeting especially as you're seeing clients evolve a bit their needs in the current environment?\nJulie Sweet: So a few things, right? So first of all, since the pandemic began, we've been very focused on building scale in markets around cloud, data and AI because that's so critical to building the digital core. So last quarter, we bought something in the Nordics, for example, that was all about getting scale. We bought something in France around mainframes because that's a very specific skillset that is relevant to moving some industries like financial services off of these core systems. And so we'd expect to continue to invest there. And we did this quarter, for example, with eLogic and with Sensis, these were acquisitions that we did this quarter, all in sort of the cloud and cloud platform technology space. Data and AI solutions will continue to be important. And again, we try to focus both on scale and getting scale in market. So we made a really exciting acquisition in Japan this quarter around data and AI solutions because we see that such a big market for us and we see a lot of interest, and it was just a great company. So, if you think about what clients are focused on building their digital core, that's going to continue to be a focus. The next digital frontier, so supply chain, digitizing supply chain and manufacturing, so we made a couple of acquisitions there this quarter, MacGregor, Stellantis. And so really, we keep very close to our strategy, which is tied to clients. They want reinvention across the enterprise, so continuing to build areas like in the digital frontier, making sure we've got scale and all of the capabilities needed across the digital core will continue to be a focus.\nJames Faucette: That's great. And then just as a quick follow-up, and it's kind of related to accounting or some of the accounting metrics that are moving in. Looking at DSOs, you guys almost always have industry-leading DSOs. But for you specifically, it looks like it's a little bit higher than last year. Can you talk us through puts and takes and what's moving that around? And should we expect to see improvement from here? Or is this something, just from a monitoring working capital, that this is the kind of level we should expect going forward?\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks for the question. And you're right, we do have industry-leading DSO, and we continue to have industry-leading DSOs. So let's talk about what we're seeing this quarter. So we had 48 days this quarter. And I think as you know, we do have a structural uptick every year from Q4 to Q1. And this is about a day of higher uptick than we would traditionally have, but it's nothing that we're concerned about. And we do feel really good about our DSO coming down by the end of the year. As I mentioned in our free cash flow guidance at the beginning of the year, we did allow for a couple of days uptick in DSO, and that's what we still expect. And maybe I'll talk a little bit about the free cash flow. So when you take a look at that in free cash flow and our expectations, overall for free cash flow for the year, you heard me reiterate the free cash flow guidance for the year. So that allows for us to have a few days uptick in DSO. And so, we're still really -- feel that the $1.1 billion is a really very strong free cash flow guidance, and it takes into account and increased DSO for the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: I wanted to follow up on the growth outlook and a little bit of the client behavior. So I'm curious if you've seen any actual change in backlog or prior book sales being deferred or potentially coming out there? So I hear you on the macro uncertainty, and I'm curious if their incidence of clients actually taking work out versus more so dragging on new bookings?\nKC McClure: Yes. So, I -- we haven't seen any real change. What you're talking about is what's happening with the work that we've already sold, we're not seeing any real change in anything that's already in our book of business in terms of what's happening with the macro. And Julie, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add?\nJulie Sweet: Yes -- no. And really I think what's important is that regardless of industry or country, the focus still is on transformation, right? There is nobody saying, \"I'm going to change less,\" right? Unfortunately, the companies are having -- sometimes are having a harder time, right, doing what they'd like to do because they're under pressure. And again, that's where our relationships really matter because we're the trusted partner, right? And if you got to know that whatever you are going to spend money on, it's going to have to deliver value, it's a flight to quality, right? And so, we've seen that since the early days of the pandemic, and it continues in this environment. And remember, that the idea of total enterprise reinvention is things are connected. Like I gave the example of the European grocer, right? One company that can transform IT, do an ad strategy, provide personalized customer experience and lower overall cost, right, that is not easy to do, and it requires industry expertise and expertise in many parts of the enterprise. And that's really where our resilience comes from. And by the way, also our ability to pivot, right, to pivot, and that particular one started as a cost play, and we were able to show the client how not only could they reduce cost, but they could actually drive more growth by connecting these things and understanding the intersections. And that's what we're focused on, right? We always start with what do our clients need. And right now, they need to be more efficient, they need to do more with less, they need to optimize what they have and we're investing. And I will tell you that one of the things that's so critical are assets and solutions. Because I was just doing or earlier this week, and I always ask the client what do you think about what you've seen, and they're like, it's amazing like you have this myWizard platform, it's got data, it's got AI, it's stuff that we can even begin to build, and you not only have it built but it's been used in thousands of clients. So that's the kind of place where our ability to invest, not just now, but over the last decade, really matters to clients. And compared to anybody out there, right, the amount of money that we're putting in acquisitions and solutions is really tremendous in driving value for our clients.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's good to hear. Follow-up, just geographic and vertical growth performance was quite broad-based here. Did you expect that to continue through the balance of the year? And I was particularly surprised on Europe and Growth Markets actually outperforming North America, is that going to persist or do you see that changing?\nJulie Sweet: By the way, my CEO of Europe and my CEO of Growth Markets like that out to their friends in North America as well. So, a little good-natured competition there, but KC, why don't you...\nKC McClure: Yes. And so in terms of what we expect to see for the year, we do expect to see Europe and Growth Markets for the full year be in the double-digit range. And we do expect that North America, which is -- as the CEO of North America says, \"I have a much, much bigger business,\" will grow at a mid- to high single-digit range for the year. And Julie, I don't know if there's anything else that you want to add on...\nJulie Sweet: Yes, on North America, I mean, they had unbelievable growth last year on a huge book of business. So growing anywhere in the high single digit to double digit again this year is quite impressive. I mean their growth was 26% last year. So, we are very pleased with kind of the growth we see ahead.\nKatie O'Conor: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call. Please go ahead.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Let me say a good quarter in a tough environment and also Happy Holidays. Let me -- I'll ask both the questions together. The first one is I see the sequential hiring growth, and obviously, many other tech companies cutting back. And I'm wondering if your positive hiring is partly a function of the rapid decline in attrition, so you might not have put the brakes on hiring yet? So, what should we expect for hiring? And could you comment on wage inflation?\nKC McClure: Yes, sure. Hi, Ashwin, nice to speak with you. So just in terms of what we expect for hiring, first of all, as you know, our ability to manage supply and demand is a core competency of ours, and we're always focused on it. And so, we did hire about -- we added about 17,000 people this quarter, as you mentioned. And we will continue to hire for the specific skills that we need. I think I made reference to that earlier, which means we may not need to hire as many people as we go throughout the year, but we'll balance that as we go through. And on wage inflation, I'll just go back to what we said when we set guidance, we did see wage inflation continuing. We do have comp increases that are kicking in that we've planned for, of course, and included in our pricing. But they are higher than they've been, and that's a statement across all industries, all geographies. And of course, that we're no different in that regard.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Understood. And then on bookings, obviously, a good quarter overall. And you've referenced the underlying sort of Consulting versus Managed Services a couple of times. I want to kind of take that forward and ask the revenue conversion question because, obviously, Consulting, one might think of shorter cycle and it gets into revenue faster; Managed Services, longer ramps and things like that. Is that a fair observation still just looking at what you signed? And how might that affect sort of the calendar 2023 layout, if you will?\nKC McClure: Yes. I think here's the way I would look at it. In terms of when you look at Managed Services and Consulting, as a broad statement, you have more the benefit of Managed Services is that you have already sold a fair amount of work, right? So while they are longer deals and they made the deals that you sell in that quarter may turn into revenue a little shorter than they would in A consulting sale, for example, which is typically a shorter duration, you have more work already sold as you go into a quarter. So there's a terrific benefit to that, which is why we like this diversity, right? We have that as well as in Consulting. They do -- the length and shape of them really do vary. And when you look at it overall, Ashwin, if you go back, and I know you followed us for a long time, and just look at our mix, of Managed Services to Consulting, it doesn't really change the bookings, really don't change much as you go throughout our history, in terms of the percent -- the proportion of each.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. I mean this year, the bigger shift that we called out is just the smaller deal volume that's tied more to the macro and the sort of the shift on to these mega transformation deals, some of which are Consulting, some of which are Managed Services, they just bleed through revenue differently. So, that's more of the impact this year that we see right now. Okay. Well, thank you very much, and happy holidays. Good. So in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support and all of our people for what you do every day. And I'd like to wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season. Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect."},{"symbol":"ACN","quarter":2,"year":2023,"date":"2023-03-23 08:00:00","content":"Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Accenture’s Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O’Conor, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatie O’Conor: Thank you, operator and thanks everyone for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I am Katie O’Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.

Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie and thank you to everyone joining today and thank you to our 738,000 people around the globe for your incredible work and commitment to our clients, which has resulted in our delivering another strong quarter of financial results and the broader 360-degree value we continue to create for all our stakeholders. Let me share a few highlights of value we created in our continued disciplined execution. I am very pleased with our record bookings for Q2 at $22.1 billion, our highest ever including 35 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, our second highest quarter on record for such bookings, representing the continued trust that our clients have in us. We delivered revenues of $15.8 billion, representing 9% growth in local currency, bringing us to $31.6 billion of revenue at 12% growth through H1 and we continued gaining market share, growing approximately 2x the market. We continued our inorganic investments with six acquisitions in strategic areas, including cloud with the acquisition of SKS in Europe, which will expand our specialized technology consulting and regulatory capabilities, enabling us to better serve our financial services clients; security with the acquisition of Morphus in Brazil, a cyber defense risk management, cyber threat intelligence service provider; and supply chain with the acquisition of Inspirage in the U.S., which will enhance our technology capabilities to accelerate innovation for clients through emerging technologies such as touchless supply chain and digital twins. We also continued our investment in our people with 10.3 million training hours, a 12% increase year-over-year. We are optimizing our business to lower costs in fiscal year 2024 and beyond, while continuing to invest in our business and our people to capture the significant growth opportunities ahead. KC will be giving you more detail on these actions. Finally, we believe our focus on creating 360-degree value differentiates us in our market. We earned the number one position in our industry for the 10th year in a row and number 32 overall on Fortune’s list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. We ranked number one in our industry and number four overall on the JUST Capital list of America’s Most JUST Companies. And we have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world’s most ethical companies for the 16th year in a row. I am very pleased that our results demonstrate once again that our strategy to be the execution partner of choice for transformation, lead in the five forces and have a diverse business across markets, industries and services continues to allow us to lead and take market share. And in a world in which all strategies lead to technology, we have distinguished ourselves in our impact to the market. Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today’s call. We were pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, setting a new bookings record at $22.1 billion, $2.5 billion higher than our previous record set in Q2 of last year, with consulting bookings close to matching our previous record. We delivered revenue growth for the quarter at the top end of our guided range as we continue to deliver on our shareholder value propositions. Before I summarize results for the quarter, let me spend a moment on the business optimization actions we are taking to reduce costs for fiscal ‘24 and beyond, which includes streamlining operations, transforming our non-billable corporate functions and consolidating office space. We estimate cost of $1.5 billion through fiscal year 2024, of which we expect to incur approximately $800 million in FY ‘23 and $700 million in FY ‘24, comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in severance and $300 million for the consolidation of office space. These actions are expected to impact roughly 2.5% or 19,000 of our current workforce, of which over half are non-billable corporate functions and include over 800 of our more than 10,000 leaders across our markets and services. Nearly half of the 19,000 people will depart by the end of fiscal year ‘23. Now, let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 9% local currency, driven by broad-based growth across all markets with more than half of our 13 industries growing double-digits. We also continue to extend our leadership position with growth estimated to be about 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. In Q2, we recorded $244 million in cost associated with the business optimization actions, which impacted operating margin by 150 basis points and EPS by $0.30. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.69, reflecting 6% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin of 13.8% increased 10 basis points, with 20 basis points expansion year-to-date and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we have invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 15 transactions. With those high level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $22.1 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 17% in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.4. Consulting bookings were $10.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Managed service bookings were also a record at $11.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.5. We were very pleased with the strength of our new bookings, which were broad-based, delivering a very strong book-to-bill across all of our geographic markets and across our services with a book-to-bill of 1.5 in operations, 1.4 in technology and 1.3 in strategy and consulting. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, a 5% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency and were at the top end of our range, adjusting for a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 4% compared to the 5% provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, a decline of 1% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 4% in local currency. Managed services revenue were $7.5 billion, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services and operations grew double-digits and strategy and consulting declined mid single-digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 5% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, health and utilities. These increases were partially offset by a decline in communications and media and high tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. In Europe, revenues grew 12% in local currency, led by growth in industrial, banking and capital markets and public service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 14% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in banking and capital markets, chemical and natural resources and public service. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.6% compared with 30.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.9% compared to 9.4% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.8% compared to 7% for the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting an adjusted 13.8% operating margin, an increase of 10 basis points from operating margin in the second quarter of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 19.2% for the second quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.69 compared with diluted EPS of $2.54 in the second quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 42 days compared to 48 days last quarter and 41 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion compared to approximately $400 million last quarter, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.3 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $108 million. Our cash balance of – at February 28 was $6.2 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.1 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average price of $273.55 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $708 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on May 15, a 15% increase over last year. Finally, turning to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders, we are partnering with Save the Children to connect with new audiences and invigorate donors through fundraising and creative campaign excellence. So at the halfway point of fiscal ‘23, we are pleased with our results. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. I will start with the overall demand environment, which is more of the same. We believe that the ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the macro environment is making it even clearer to clients that they need to change more, not less. And that two of the five key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade, the need for total enterprise reinvention and the ability to access, create and unlock the potential of talent are critical to succeed in the near, medium and long-term. We see two common themes. First, all strategies continue to lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. This is reflected in the latest market estimates, which are down slightly, but are still hovering around 5%. And second, companies remain focused on executing compressed transformations to achieve lower cost, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster. We remain laser focused on pivoting to our clients’ changing needs and being relevant across the enterprise from the frontline to core operations to corporate functions. Our ability to advise, shape and deliver value-led transformations, leveraging the breadth of our services from strategy and consulting to our strategic managed services across all industries and geographic markets is what differentiates Accenture. Now, I will give you more color on the quarter and in particular, how total enterprise reinvention and talent are critical to our clients. For example, we are helping Shionogi & Co. Limited, a Japanese pharmaceutical company with a compressed transformation to improve its business process efficiency and create a more agile organization. We will enter into a joint venture with the company that will provide managed services capability to oversee back office functions such as human resources, finance and accounting, public relations, facility management, procurement and marketing. The joint venture will also be charged with the management of the pharmacovigilance function from safety management operations to post-marketing operations to regulatory compliance. As part of this transformation, we will upscale over 400 employees, enabling them to play a greater role in the growth and development of the wider business, hence demonstrating the value of all our services from strategy and consulting, our deep industry knowledge to technology and operations coming together to enable the clients transformation. I would like to take a moment to recognize Egawa-san, our Head of the Japan market unit and our extraordinary people in Japan for how they are consistently creating value for our clients with double-digit revenue growth for each of the past 5 years. As clients focus on building their digital core with a modern cloud-based infrastructure, our cloud business continues to grow very strong double-digits. For example, we are working with the state of Missouri to replace its legacy applications and infrastructure with a modern ERP in the cloud, introducing new capabilities in finance, supply chain management, human capital management, payroll and budgeting. As the current ERP system no longer fully meets the business needs of the state, they are looking for a modern system that is efficient, scalable and flexible, all delivered by a best-in-class implementation partner. This compressed transformation, one of the earliest and most complex ERP implementations for any state will help reduce operating expenses, provide opportunities for upskilling and improve customer experience and services. We are partnering with minority and women-owned businesses on this transformation and we will bring in apprentices, the program’s lifecycle part of our shared commitment with the state of Missouri to foster diversity and inclusion. With our cloud-first strategy, our approach has been to help clients migrate to the cloud and then partner with them on their journey to grow and innovate in the cloud. Our cloud growth is driven by both migration and clients who are moving forward on this journey, such as Enel, one of our largest utilities clients who has taken their mass migration to cloud a few years ago to the next level, changing their operating model, tools and talent and largely automating IT operations. We are now helping them accelerate the modernization of their application landscape, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, support a significant acquisition and divestment agenda and pivot to platform-based business model for integrated retail delivery beyond meter services, grid and renewable energy. Using cloud as their operating systems is helping this market leader manage increasing levels of complexity by bringing together data, AI and applications to optimize their operations and accelerate growth. A strong and secure digital core also is essential to total enterprise reinvention. We are seeing continued very strong demand for our security services, which experienced another quarter of very strong double-digit growth. We are working with Empresas CMPC SA, a Chilean pulp and paper company and a cybersecurity transformation of their plant operations. We will implement a security program across its 48 industrial sites focused on threat detection, management and response as well as governance and workforce training. Through our global and local Industry X capabilities, we will help strengthen the company’s cybersecurity expenses through continuous monitoring of its physical locations and equipment. We continue to lead in managed services, which experienced strong growth again this quarter at 16%. Managed services are strategic for our clients, because they enable clients to move faster, leveraging our digital platform expertise and talent as well as delivering cost efficiencies. And our clients are turning to Accenture because of the depth and breadth of our industry, functional and technology expertise that we bring together into the transformation journey. Our approach to managed services is to both run and transform and run and modernize. We deliver cost savings as table stakes. For example, we are partnering with the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions, which is responsible for welfare pensions and child maintenance policy to modernize its legacy systems, eliminating backlogs and delivering a better experience for citizens and employees. We developed a cloud-based intelligent optimization platform that combines robotic process automation, AI, analytics and machine learning to provide bots as a service to create the equivalent of a virtual workforce available 24/7. With routine tests now automated, the organization has already saved 2.4 million human hours, which can be reallocated to more complex higher value tasks. Let me pause to thank our global H&PS colleagues for their amazing contributions as evidenced by 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. As our clients continue to prioritize cost optimization as well as growth in Vigilance, Song is more relevant than ever. In Song, which grew strong double-digits this quarter, clients are focused on more capital efficient growth that creates efficiency, drive short-term growth and optimizes existing assets with clear outcomes and shorter time horizons to keep up with the pace of change with customers and technology. We have moved quickly to help clients seize new opportunities in contact centers, not only for enhanced customer service, but also customer acquisition and growth. We are working with a global biopharmaceutical leader in North America to reinvent digital marketing at scale. Driven by data and using technologies integrated with SynOps, the company will be able to create, produce and deliver consistent world class content that informs and educates healthcare providers and patient communities around the world, helping to deliver innovative health services. We are working with the Prada Group, the Italian luxury fashion player, to offer its customers an entirely new customization experience through an online 3D configurator. Accenture Song created a digital twin of Prada’s iconic show called America’s Cup, which allows shoppers to fully customize it from material to color to trim across the overlay, lining, sole and other parts. With more than 50 million possible configurations, more than any web platform could handle, this innovative approach allows customers to see high resolution 3D models of their custom builds with the same quality and fidelity as a physical shoe. Song solution to online product customization is fully scalable to the cloud. It gives Prada the flexibility to apply the same strategy to other products, ensuring the outstanding experience that their shoppers expect. As I continue to move across the enterprise, industries and markets, I want to also highlight Industry X, which grew very strong double digits again this quarter, and which we believe is the next digital frontier where our digital engineering capabilities are advancing sustainability services. For example, we are working with Recharge Industries, a battery research and production company in Australia, to help design and engineer one of the world’s largest lithium-ion battery facilities. Once built, the facility will generate up to 30-gigawatt hours of storage capacity per year. Finally, moving to the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolution. We’ve talked about the importance of artificial intelligence in building the digital core for our clients. While generative AI has recently burst into the popular imagination, at Accenture, we’ve been working with the technology from its earliest stages and are already applying it at clients. For example, we’re working with a multinational bank to transform how it manages high volumes of post-trade processing e-mails every day. We are leveraging a generative AI solution as it is built to understand the context of e-mails with high accuracy. It automatically routes large numbers of e-mails, daily to relevant teams and draft responses with recommended actions and related information. Our work will help reduce manual effort and risk, boost worker efficiency and improve interactions with customers. And finally, on that note, we will release our Tech Vision 2023 on March 30. The 4th and 5th key forces of change we have identified for the next decade at a metaverse and ongoing tech revolution. And this year’s tech vision is particularly relevant and actionable as our clients face a rapidly changing landscape in which generative AI, metaverse cloud, science, tech and other technologies are driving more opportunities for change and reinvention. This year’s vision will explore how these technologies and more are blending the physical world and the virtual world into a shared reality, creating a huge opportunity for our clients and for Accenture. Now turning to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal ‘23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.7 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 3.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal ‘22 and reflects an estimated 3% to 7% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year ‘23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 4.5% compared to fiscal ‘22. For the full fiscal ‘23, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal ‘22, which assumes an inorganic contribution of 2%. We expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal ‘23 GAAP operating margin by 120 basis points and EPS by $0.96. We expect our anticipated gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies to impact EPS by $0.39. Our guidance for full year fiscal ‘23 excludes these impacts. For adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year ‘23 to be 15.3% to 15.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal ‘22 results. We expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal ‘22. We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal ‘23 to be in the range of $11.41 to $11.63, or 7% to 9% growth over fiscal ‘22 results. For the full fiscal ‘23, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion, $300 million higher than our previous guidance. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. With that, let’s open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O’Conor: Thanks, KC. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much. I had to ask, given the great bookings here, your confidence in being able to replenish those bookings as we look to the third quarter and ahead? I’m sure a lot of people are thinking what’s going on in the month of February and March as well. I know your guidance implies some reacceleration in the fourth quarter, but just curious about your ability to replenish on the bookings side? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. So we do feel good about our pipeline even after our record bookings this quarter. And our sales outlook for the next quarter, Q3 is solid. We expect to have slightly lighter bookings than what we’ve had compared to the record quarter that we just had.\nJulie Sweet: And maybe just to add a little color. Look, as you can see in our bookings, there is just continued strong demand for the larger transformational deals, right? And the need to, in particular, build the digital core. And I’m personally working right now with clients across insurance, healthcare, consumer goods, banking and telecom, all of whom are very focused on how do we upgrade our – get rid of our technical debt, how do we build more resilience. They are trying to build digital products, but they have got really old systems. And so we remain in the early innings of building the kind of digital core that really need to transform every part of the enterprise. And so we continue to feel good, not just about our pipeline, but about the demand we’re seeing really rooted in our view that all companies are going to have to do total enterprise reinvention across the enterprise that it’s really a continuous cycle starting with a digital – a strong digital core. And there is a lot of work to do on building those cores out.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good. Glad to hear. Very encouraging. So given that, given both your comments and the optimization, I’m just trying to think about is it more playing offense versus defense? So I’m just trying to think about – I know a lot of your clients are going through similar optimization efforts as well. How does this one fit given that? And should we still think about this within the 10 to 30 basis points of typical margin expansion that we think about sort of philosophically? Or could this be incremental?\nKC McClure: Yes. So just let me answer the last part first, is you should view this as creating the room in our P&L to ensure that we can continue to deliver on that enduring shareholder value model, including the 10 to 30 basis points, which for a short period of time will be on an adjusted basis. So – and as you think about it, it is – I like that, is it offense or defense. It is offensive. I mean if you look at where we are today, right, we’ve got record bookings, a strong quarter of – strong view of the year, 8% to 10%, 91% chargeability. We’re going after structural cost, right, to ensure that we’re in a better position. As you know, we’ve been dealing with the difficult challenges of compounding wage inflation. And we’ve been doing that with pricing, but we’ve also been doing that with cost efficiencies and digitizing. And we have identified an opportunity to go after more structural costs to kind of create that resilience and that room in the P&L as we look forward. So very much in our view, getting ahead of and dealing with these structural issues that have been created over the last couple of years.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Awesome. That’s great. Great results then. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to follow-up on a couple of those items. First, can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing around the actual conversion and decision cycles? Obviously, the bookings themselves speak well to being able to do conversions, but are we seeing any changes in the sales cycle times or the types of projects that customers may want to engage in?\nJulie Sweet: Well, let me just start with the type of projects. I mean what we’ve been seeing over the last several quarters is just a laser focus on cost, right? So most programs, clients want to see a shorter return on investments, right, more focused on cost. They love cost and growth, but it has to be, in most cases, a shorter return on the investment. At the same time, it’s important that not all industries are in the same place, right? So if you’ve got industries like, say, in the high-tech area, and some spots on retail, for example, cost optimization is very dominant, right? If you have – you’ve got some of the other less affected industries, say, insurance, energy, it’s – everyone wants to be more resilient and lower cost. But they are really trying to deal with their technical debt, they are thinking about growth, how do you reimagine the customer experience. And so I would say a common theme is that in this kind of an environment, everyone does want to be optimizing costs, but where they are focusing is different by industry is what I would say first. And then just to your first part of your question about are you seeing changes in decision making and I’d let KC talk to you about the yields in our pipeline because you all saw, in general, seeing a trend toward these larger deals. So there is – and we talked about this in the last couple of quarters, we’re seeing less of the smaller deals in SMC and to some extent, SI, particularly in North America, where we’re seeing more caution. North America had record sales this quarter. But in areas tending towards the bigger transformational deals, not the smaller SNC and to some extent, SI deals. And those – that transformational pipeline, which is our strategy, right, like if you think about it, what have we been trying to drive for the last few years? We want to be at the center of our clients’ business, we want to be able to be relevant, really help them transform and then be well positioned to continue to be that partner. And I would just say, Enel in my script, is a great example of that. I mean they are hugely innovative utility. They were very early in cloud. We help them get to the cloud. And now they are modernizing and once again being super innovative. That’s exactly the way we want to work with our clients, be their core and then be there for their next big transformation. Maybe, KC, if you want to just comment on the yields real quick.\nKC McClure: Yes, sure. No problem. So when we – let me focus really on consulting bookings because it is important to understand the impact of F&C and our consulting bookings and also how to what we’re doing in our larger transformation deals because they do convert to revenue at a slower pace. So as I mentioned in my script, I was very pleased with our SNC bookings and our overall consulting bookings, which were very close to the record that we had last year. And SNC participates, and is a critical part of winning the larger deals, which we have 35 clients over $100 million. And so what you’ll see is in SNC, you may see a conversion that’s a little bit slower than we typically have because we still do have some pressure in our smaller deals, particularly in North America. And so maybe I’ll just – how does that all work in terms of yield then? What that means for next quarter? As we look at SNC, I mentioned that we had a modest decline, a decline in mid-single digits this quarter. We think we will be in the same zone overall in Q3, and we’re going to look to reconnect with SNC growth in Q4. It may take us a little bit more time than that. But I just want to make that connection to your question as it relates to our very strong consulting bookings in SNC. They were definitely part of that discussion and clearly part of that the reason why we are able to get the 35 clients in a $100 million, but you will see that come into our P&L at a little bit slower conversion.\nJames Faucette: Thank you. That’s really helpful. And then just quickly, on D&A, it seems like we’ve seen a little bit of a deceleration there. How are you thinking about D&A going forward? And what was inorganic contribution in the quarter and how should we think about that for the year? Thanks.\nKC McClure: So I’ll just maybe reiterate the contribution for the year. So we now see inorganic contribution to be about 2%. And acquisitions can be lumpy. And we – as you know, we can’t always really control the timing, but there is no change to our strategy. In any given year, you’ll hear us kind of go up or down a bit on the percentage of contribution. No change.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Wanted to just ask about…\nJulie Sweet: Good morning. \nBryan Keane: Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the communications, media and technology group that did come in at flat local currency and is kind of a standout versus the others. Can you just talk a little bit about what’s happening there and what the outlook might be?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. That’s primarily happening in North America where we’ve got comms and media and high-tech are more challenged, cutting back spending for sort of obvious reasons. And then our software and platforms business, which has been really a strong business for us for the last few years has – it’s still slightly positive, but has come down a lot, and I think for kind of obvious reasons that we’re all reading in the press. And so we do think this will last for a bit of time as you look at sort of some of the ways they are approaching spending in that. And – but it will eventually come back, and these are great companies. And we’re helping them in many places, but their spending is just lower right now. So that’s – I think long-term, we’re very positive. These are all great companies. And this why it’s so great that we’re diverse, right, that we serve so many and not just diversity in industries but in markets because you’re seeing a different picture, for example, in comms and media in Europe, where it was growing double digits last quarter in growth markets where it was positive. So the diversity of our business really plays to our strength and why we’re continuing to deliver strong financial results.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Got it. And I was just trying to reconcile in my head the strong bookings, but the actions also taken to lower costs in fiscal year ‘24. What does that signal, I guess, for the demand environment in fiscal year ‘24? Should we expect slightly lower growth rates than typical as a result of the actions taken?\nJulie Sweet: No. I mean the actions, I can just kind of reground you on like what we’ve been saying, right, which is we’ve been achieving hypergrowth and there is been wage inflation like none of us have ever experienced and it’s compounding. And we’ve been addressing that through a combination of improved pricing, cost efficiencies, and so this is really us taking a step back and being able to more structurally address the impact of compounding wage inflation. So it’s a real positive for how we’re moving forward. And think of it as really being – creating more room in the P&L so that when you think about our enduring shareholder value proposition is we still expect next year to grow faster than the market. We expect to invest at scale in our business, to deliver 10 to 30 basis point margin expansion on an adjusted basis, to have a disciplined capital allocation, including a meaningful return to our shareholders. So that is a commitment – this is an offensive mood to say, yes, today, we’ve got great demand, we’ve got great utilization, and we can take out more structural costs to put us in a better position as we move forward.\nBryan Keane: Okay. Great. That’s really helpful. Congrats.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a kind of follow-up on the sort of connecting the dots questions. I noticed that your headcount growth slowed a bit this quarter, up 6% year-on-year and was flat sequentially. Can you kind of connect the dots that side, what you are seeing and sort of what you’re thinking about on the hiring side with the fact that you have record bookings in the quarter and then typically, those two things kind of move a little bit more in tandem? Thank you.\nKC McClure: Yes, sure. Thanks, Lisa. So maybe I’ll just first start with just looking back over the last two previous quarters. We added 28,000 people in the previous quarters. So let’s first start there. And you’re right, Lisa, when you take a look at what we were able to accomplish this quarter, first of all, we had record bookings. We drove 9% – 9.3% revenue growth, and we had 91% utilization of our people, right? So we have the skills and all the people we needed to deliver to the demand in the market. And if I look – answering your question, looking forward, we sequentially did not add headcount from Q1 to Q2. We see that being about the same in Q2 to Q3. And then looking forward, based on the outlook that we have now, we do see that we would add additional heads in the fourth quarter.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. Great. And then my follow-up is related to AI. Maybe this one is, Julie, for you. Just can you talk a bit about how you apply AI in your own operations? I know every time this topic kind of stirs up, there is this question of whether it’s a positive or a negative for the operations of IT services firms. Can you just talk about how you sort of applied internally and how you think about that over the long-term? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. In fact, I was just at a client this week where we are helping them really transform their whole IT department. And one of the things they want from us is our myWizard platform, which is a great way of explaining how over the last several years, we have built a platform that integrates the best-in-class technology. So, we didn’t write our own code, right. We use the best technologies. And the way it uses AI, for example, is that when a ticket comes in to address something, an IT issue, AI looks at it, identifies whether or not it’s been a problem solved before, in some cases, can solve the problem, in other cases, routes it to the right people. And then it learns from every ticket. So, in the past, when we have talked about – with you about why is it – how do you think about revenue and people, we said, look, we have already been breaking that for years now because we are using so much technology and AI in how we are delivering all of our technology jobs. The same thing is true, for example, with testing, which is incredibly automated, using different technology, including AI. We are continuing to use AI in the way we run our business, for example, in how we look at our accounts payable and receivables and finding ways where we can optimate to have better efficiencies there. We are using it today in the way we are delivering our consulting services as well and definitely very much so in how we look at sales and being able to predict based on lots of factors. Should we be running after the sale or not, or can we show the data that these – this is not the right kind of sale, we are not the right fit. So, we have increasingly been using AI, both in how we deliver services as well as in how we run ourselves. Of course, our SynOps platform for operations is also AI-enabled. It’s one of the reasons why clients turn to us because it’s helping them digitize faster. They are not having to build these things. So, long-term, we see these technology changes, things like generative AI is playing to our strengths because to use these technologies, it requires deep understanding of the industry, the use cases, the process changes. When people talk about the new kinds of generative AI, which we are super excited about, being like a co-pilot to human beings, the entire process has to be changed in order to make that work. You have got to up-skill the people and you have to be able to do all of that in a very responsible way. So, we are already working with. There has been a lot of demand to understand this. And in understanding it, understanding actually how hard it is to be able to implement at scale in an enterprise versus, I am assuming you are – we are all having fun playing with it, but how you build that into an enterprise is very different and a great opportunity, and we are partnering with all the major players to help them take the technology go from technology to implementation to impact.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks Lisa.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Could you delve into demand trends in the financial services vertical in a little greater depth, especially given the evolving banking crisis we have seen in the last month or so, particularly with some of the regional banks struggling? And maybe as part of that, if you could just remind us of your profile within bank-related IT services, smaller banks versus regionals and money centers.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. As a client base, we skew towards the larger banks across all of the markets. So, we don’t comment on individual clients, but we don’t have any big exposure to kind of the smaller regional banks and in general. So, as you sort of think about the stepping brake, obviously, the developments on the banks for the – are still early in the last couple of weeks. So, as I talk about demand trends for our clients, which are generally the bigger banks, a couple of things really stand out. So, first of all, there is a lot of focus on their technical debt, because the banks, a lot of them are still in the mainframe. Our mainframe practice really across industry has growing like gangbusters right now as clients across the industry are really having to take on some of that harder technical debt, which they need to do because the more and more they digitize their services, which is a continuing trend in financial services, if the systems behind it aren’t agile, then it can take a lot of time to introduce new services. You have got to – oftentimes, we will have multiple systems. You will have to test things. You can’t go as fast. And so the banks are kind of reaching their limits in terms of what they can do without touching their core. So, we expect the sort of addressing the core to be a really important driver. We are seeing, in asset management, more and more views – more and more companies in asset management, really digitizing. They had been kind of slower behind the banks. And then insurance, we are working with leading insurers across the world who not only are kind of trying to catch up because banking was ahead of insurance, but finding sort of new and exciting opportunities on how to use data, in particular, to grow their business, how to transform their experience and claims. So, financial services which covers banking, capital markets and insurance, we continue to see as a vibrant area. Where things are slowing down a bit in the U.S. where we have been a big player is in integration. We will see that might pick up again. Let’s just see how all of this shakes out. But that has slowed down for a bit. Hopefully, that gives you some color.\nDavid Togut: It does. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning. Thanks guys. I just wanted to ask about Q3 bookings. If you can discuss consulting versus managed services, just expectations there? I mean I think the year-over-year comparison for consulting at least gets a bit easier.\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks Jason. I am not going to comment specifically on kind of individual breakout of the bookings. But maybe I will just reiterate what I mentioned to Tien-Tsin. So, we had record bookings this quarter. We do see that next quarter. We will have lighter bookings than what we had this quarter in terms of the record bookings. Overall, what you can see, Jason, you know us well, is that the mix right now is much more favored halfway through the year to managed services, all the reasons that Julie talked about. We were really pleased with consulting this quarter that did – we thought it was going to be strong, and it came in even stronger. And so that, we are very encouraged by that, and we do have a strong pipeline, and we continue to see solid bookings for Q3.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. And then just on the cost side, what’s the estimated savings from the cost takeout program? And I know the charges will aggregate to $1.5 billion, but I just wanted to understand kind of what the fully annualized run rate of savings is? And are you essentially reinvesting the savings? I mean I know at least for this year, we are not changing the underlying margin guidance. So, just wanted to get a picture of how much of this is being reinvested, or are you essentially just offsetting some other headwinds around wage inflation, etcetera?\nKC McClure: Thanks for the question. Let me just first start with FY ‘23. So, the actions that we are taking are not about FY ‘23. They are about FY ‘24 and beyond. So, in terms of what we will do with those savings, it really is going to depend, Jason, on how the market develops, the growth opportunities that we have next year. And as Julie said, the key part of what we are really focused on is just going to give us more room to continue to execute our enduring shareholder value proposition, what she mentioned. And I know you know that.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes. Alright. So, just…\nJulie Sweet: Keep your model – to be clear, keep your model 10 basis point to 30 basis point adjusted margin expansion. We are going to invest in our business and we are going to grow faster than the market.\nJason Kupferberg: We love the consistency. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hey. Thanks guys. I mean when you put the pieces together with the bookings we are seeing and the actual changes in the efficiency, it really does sound like we are finally seeing more of a divergence in linearity between headcount growth and bookings capabilities and revenue contribution. So, I mean I know you mentioned AI, obviously, is a big theme. But is there other factors that we can point to that are structurally part of the model now, or is it a function of the mix type of bookings or anything else?\nKC McClure: Yes. Maybe I will just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of headcount, Darrin, and what we are recording in revenue in terms of how we are generating our revenue. And Julie, if you want to add in, you certainly can. But in terms of what you are seeing is we have been very focused on hiring, balancing our supply, demand to what we need to both sell and drive the revenue to meet our client demand and continue to take market share. And part of what you are seeing throughout the year is we have been continuing – you have heard us talk about us really focusing on continued strong pricing. Again, reminder, that when we talk about pricing, it’s the margin on the work that we sold. And that has been improving over the last five quarters. It’s not stable, which we are really happy with. And so some of that is part – there is a part of that that’s helping to drive our revenue production as well.\nJulie Sweet: And I would just say, a lot of its mix, right. If you have longer transformational deals like the numbers of people that you need to drive are different. So, I wouldn’t say there is some big, wait a minute, we have got some new inflection point where you have disconnected more. As I talked about earlier, we have been disconnecting to some degree, for a while now, but there is no big change in that perspective. Just as we have executed our strategy. And I think it’s so important to understand that it has been a deliberate strategy to say we want to do transformational deals. We want to take our SNC people who have deep industry and functional knowledge, put them together with our technology people to do either big implementations, right, that are changing the digital core or transformations that are coupled with managed services and just how that works out. And so while we love when the economy is booming and SNC and the small deals are also booming, the strategy is to be at the core so that we continue – we help them with one big project, we understand their company and met it more. We take them on the next big project, and we are really getting that kind of stickiness in our relationships. And so we will kind of deal with the sort of softness in the smaller deals. But over time, this is exactly what we want to do. And in fact, if you think about this year, consulting – last quarter, we thought consulting this year would be mid-single digits to high-single digits. We now see it as mid-single digits for the year, and we are fine with that, right, because that’s about kind of lower SNC and SI smaller deals. North America in December, we thought it was going to be mid-single to high-single digits. We now see that as the mid-single digits for the year. Again, it’s because sort of the caution that’s impacting the smaller deals, record sales, great large transformational deals, and that’s just going to how it deals with. And that’s why, as KC said before, SNC, we are going to see a very similar performance next quarter probably, and it may take a little bit longer to reconnect with growth. But remember, we don’t look at that as separate. We see SNC as a competitive differentiator for these larger transformational deals, which is our strategy.\nDarrin Peller: That actually makes a lot of sense. One follow-up on that and related is the cyclicality of business is it’s not surprising, you would see some of the smaller deals get impacted first by pause or concern among enterprise spending. When we think about the larger transformational side, the pipeline is longer. The sales cycle is longer there. So, having that strong still is probably not – if you do – given how well you guys execute, it’s not shocking, I guess. But on the same side, the magnitude of strength was better than I think we expected. And so looking ahead, what in your experience, cyclically, when do you see that sort of slow down if the economy does take a step down?\nJulie Sweet: Look, it’s never say never I guess the economy slowing down and what we do it, but I really stay focused. We try to stay focused on our strategy being relevant across cycles, so – and basically growing stronger than the market. And so the market is still faster than market, it’s still kind of hovering around 5%. And so that’s what we kind of watch more than the economy because technology is so core to every strategy that when the economy goes down, what are you seeing, well, people are saying, we got to optimize. We have got a lower cost. We have got to do managed services. So, we watch more – the economy can kind of do an uplift, right. But what we are trying to always do is grow faster than the market. So, that’s the big indicator for us. And you see it’s a very strong market. And it makes sense. I mean I will just tell you like the amount of the just technical debt across these industries and how much work to do, we are still very much in early innings of what needs to be done to take advantage of cool things like generative AI. You got to have data.\nDarrin Peller: Yes. Awesome. Alright. Thanks Julie. Thanks KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And that last question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi guys. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on consolidation activity. And whether – how much of this has helped to really offset some of the areas that have pulled back in the shorter cycle work? And I guess has that picked up meaningfully? And if you were to step back and look at those 35 deals over $100 billion, can you give us a sense of the mix of those that might include an aspect of vendor consolidation?\nJulie Sweet: Vendor consolidation is certainly a part of what’s going on in the market, but there are some industries that did that a long time ago in some clients. So, I am not – I don’t have the numbers off hand of what we have in our 35 clients. But I am not seeing that as sort of the big driver of our growth. Right now, we are often telling clients who like basically need to get revenue faster, but more – it’s interesting, the vendor consolidation for many of our clients is less about cost and more that a lot of the industries, like say, consumer goods, telecom where they have lots of different countries. It’s very hard to move to a platform business and sort of build things consistently if you have a ton of different vendors, right, because you want the stuff done in the same way. And so the – it’s interesting the vendor consolidation play for many is more about how do we actually implement a strategy of kind of moving to global platforms being able to have a single approach to data, super hard to do if you have got 50 vendors to 100 vendors. So, I would just say it’s tied to exactly the kind of strategies that we are advising clients on, but no big theme for us.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, with the record bookings in managed services, any near-term margin impacts we should consider as you ramp up and invest in those? Any considerations on adjusted operating margin cadence as you go through the second half?\nKC McClure: Yes. No, there is nothing unusual.\nBryan Bergin: Alright. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you. So, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support in all our people for what you are doing for our clients and for each other every day.

Welcome to Accenture's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Katie O’Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatie O’Conor: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announced. As the operator just mentioned, I am Katie O’Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results; KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market position before KC provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we will discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those factors set forth in today’s news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.

Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie and thank you to everyone joining today, and thank you to our people around the world for their dedication and commitment, which is how we are able to consistently deliver 360 degree value for all our stakeholders, our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities. Turning to the quarter, I will start with the financials. While the macro environment continues to be uncertain overall, in Q3 we delivered solid revenue and sales with very strong profitability and very strong free cash flow, while continuing to significantly invest in our business. Now getting into the highlights, we had bookings of $17.2 billion, including 26 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, bringing the total year to date 85, which is 11 more than the same time last year. We delivered revenues of $16.6 billion, representing 5% growth with North America growing 2%, Europe at 7% and growth markets at 9%, all in local currency, bringing us to $48.1 billion of revenue at 10% growth fiscal year to date. Revenues were impacted by lower than expected small deal sales, especially in strategy and consulting and systems integration and lower than expected results in the communications, media and high-tech industry group for the quarter. Excluding [CMT] (ph), our business grew 8% globally, 7% in North America, 9% in Europe and 10% in growth market in local currency. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points, grew adjusted EPS 14% over last year and delivered free cash flow of $3.1 billion. And over the past 11 quarters we have operated at 91% or higher utilization, leveraging our digital enterprise to connect our sales, staffing, hiring and skill needs to make proactive real time decisions. We are on track with the business optimization actions to lower costs in fiscal 2024 and beyond, while continuing to significantly invest in our business with five acquisitions in strategic areas this quarter, bringing the total investment in acquisitions year to date to $1.3 billion. We invested in Cloud, Data and AI with the acquisition Nextira in North America, Objectivity in the UK and Einr in Norway. We also invested in sustainability with the acquisition of Green Domus in Brazil and in modern ERP services with Bourne Digital in Australia. We continued to take market share growing about two times the market. Now turning to other aspects of the 360 degree value we delivered this quarter. We continue to invest in learning for our people with 9 million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 13 hours per person, giving them the skills to grow as our clients' needs evolve. We're incredibly pleased that we were recognized as a top 10 place to work in seven countries. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, Mexico, the Philippines and the U. S. Collectively, these countries represent nearly 70% of people. Vibrant communities are important for our business success and digital scaling helps ensure vibrant communities thrive. In collaboration with L'Oreal and our NGO partner, [Shambu] (ph) Foundation, we are supporting women in India to build digital literacy skills alongside the technical skills needed to access jobs in the beauty industry. Together, we have collectively created sustainable livelihoods for 2,500 women across 10 states in India, accelerating equality, delivering social impact in the community and continuing our commitment to embed diversity and inclusion in everything we do. Finally, this year we are proud to earn the number 22 position on [Brand Z's] (ph) prestigious top 100 most valuable global brands list, our highest rank today. Over to you KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our third quarter results and we are on track to deliver or exceed all aspects of our guidance provided in September on an adjusted basis. Now let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 5% local currency, driven by high single or double digit growth in seven of our 13 industries. While we've been highlighting the pressures in our CMT industry group all year, this quarter the revenue was lower than expected with a decline of 8% in local currency. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.19, reflecting 14% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, an increase of 20 basis points over Q3 last year and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.1 billion and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year to date, we have invested $1.3 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 20 transactions. With those high level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $17.2 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 4% in local currency with an overall book to bill of 1.0. We were very pleased with our 26 clients with quarterly bookings over $100 million. Consulting bookings were $8.9 billion with a book to bill of 1. Managed services were $8.3 billion with a book to bill of 1.1. Turning now to revenues, revenues for the quarter were $16.6 billion, a 3% increase in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2.5% compared to the approximately 3.5% headwind provided in our business outlook last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.7 billion, a decline of 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% local currency. We see the same level of consulting decline in Q4. Managed services revenues were $7.9 billion, up 10% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services grew high single digits. Operations grew double digits and we expect high single digit growth in Q4. Strategy and consulting declined high single digits this quarter and we see declines continuing in Q4. Regarding our market share, we extended our leadership position with growth estimated to be about two times the market which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Now as a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public company competitors, which represents about third of our addressable market. We used a consistent methodology to compare our financial results and theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 2% in local currency driven by growth in Public Service for our U.S. federal business, Health and Utilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in Communications and Media, High-tech, Software and Platforms and Banking and Capital Markets. In Europe, revenue grew 7% local currency, led by growth in Banking and Capital Markets, Industrial and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Italy, Germany and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 9% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service, Chemicals and Natural Resources and Banking and Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Japan. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.4% compared with 32.9% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.3% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.5% compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q3 we recorded $347 million in costs associated with the business optimization actions we announced last quarter, which decreased operating margin by 210 basis points and EPS by $0.42. This quarter, we also recognized a gain in our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter and adjusted 16.3% operating margin, an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.19 compared with diluted EPS of $2.79 in the third quarter last year. Days source outstanding were 42 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 44 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.1 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.3 billion net of property and equipment additions of $142 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $8.5 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.8 million shares for $789 million at an average price of [$279.65] (ph) per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $708 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on August, a 15% increase over last year. So in closing, we remain committed to delivering on our long-standing financial objectives, growing faster than the market and taking share, generating modest margin expansion and stronger earnings, while at the same time, investing at scale for long-term market leadership, generating strong free cash flow and returning cash to shareholders. Now let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet : Thank you, KC. As we look at demand in our larger deals, we continue to see two common themes that I've highlighted before. First, the rapid rise of generative AI interest among our clients highlights yet again that all strategies lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. And second, companies remain focused on total enterprise reinvention as they execute compressed transformation to achieve lower costs, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster. Now let me give you more color on the quarter to bring this to life. Starting with the digital core, our cloud momentum continues with very strong double-digit growth in Q3 as clients priorities building a strong and secure foundation for reinvention. We have been working with ENI, a global energy company for more than 30 years. Now we are helping them as they continue their hybrid cloud transformation and embark on a total enterprise reinvention strategy with a focus on sustainability, digital transformation and security. We are managing their IT infrastructure and telecommunications integration and helping implement new operating models, all hosted in the ENI green data center, one of the largest data bunkers in the industry to securely hold the company's data. The ENI green data center houses one of the most powerful nongovernmental supercomputers in the world, enabling the highest use of data across the value chain from exploration and production to the energy of the future. New operating models will help exploit the full value of data, AI and cybersecurity for faster adoption of new business processes. This transformation is the first step toward creating a secure digital core that will accelerate ENI's energy transition, drive innovation in AI and R&D and build even greater resilience. Clients are also working with us to do multifaceted compressed transformation that utilize all of our deep industry and functional expertise in our SNC services, along with our outstanding technology services. We are helping DuPont, a global multi-industrial specialty products company with a compressed transformation to standardize their finance processes and achieve operational excellence. Building on our trusted relationship of over 35 years, we are now supporting our client with its strategic pivot to innovation-based growth across electronics, sustainable water and protection solutions, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. We've been supporting their transformation to an agile cloud-based IT infrastructure to maximize data access, drive efficiency and modernize their landscape. Our work with DuPont is focused on achieving greater resilience, reducing costs and increasing revenue growth and shaping its portfolio through M&A with industry-leading innovation for long-term success. With companies expanding their digital footprint and cyber risk widening security continues to rise in importance as a fundamental part of the digital core with very strong double-digit growth in Q3. We are working with a food and beverage company to strengthen their cybersecurity and prevent vulnerabilities along the supply chain. Building on previous operations transformation work, we are now providing managed security services, which will cover perimeter security, detection and response as well as threat intelligence and monitoring dark web activities. We also will provide day-to-day identity, data and privacy management, helping provide a holistic security approach for our client. We're helping a global universal bank future-proof their cryptographic landscape and corresponding risks for over 1,000 applications, procedures and data. Based on the analysis, we will develop and implement an end-to-end mitigation strategy, including evaluation of solution vendor strategies, mitigation principles as well as change management procedures. We will also design and implement post-quantum methods and new architecture blueprints, which will help scale the solution, all to help the bank achieve post-quantum computing readiness. Our Managed Services continued to grow double digits in Q3, demonstrating the relevance of our approach to run, digitize and transform our clients' operations. We're providing a global health care and insurance company with managed services to help run its complex claims and membership processes. As part of our long-standing relationship with the company, we will improve the efficiency and quality of these tasks and simplify the customer journey, ensuring members can easily access the support they need when they need it. Its employees will now have more time to focus on boosting customer satisfaction by better serving its millions of customers around the world. A new cost solution has also been introduced to determine fair and accurate pricing for the company when purchasing services and products from vendors to reduce costs across the business. We recently worked with a major media brand to launch a streaming platform that will help attract new subscribers, expanding their content portfolio and power-targeted broadcasting and advertising offerings, all while lowering costs. We helped engineer aspects of the new platform from the content supply chain to the player experience, ensuring that customers have a seamless viewing experience across all devices and platforms and enabling the company to use data insights to continually enhance its platform. We delivered the program as part of a managed services arrangement, demonstrating the industry and engineering innovation that we bring to help clients reinvent their business with cloud, data and AI. As clients continue to reimagine and prioritize customer experience, Song experienced strong double-digit growth again in Q3. We are partnering with Virgin Media O2, a British media and telecommunications company to reimagine their customer experience. Accenture Song will design a new, more predictive and personalized customer journey, enabled by an AI-powered cloud-based digital core. Customer care journeys will be omnichannel, combining customer calls, chat and instant messaging to increase first-time resolution and upselling, leading to greater customer satisfaction. We also will deploy our managed services capabilities to support contact center activity using AI to provide timely agent assistance and route calls intelligently to drive precision and reduce call volume. Our work will help build brand loyalty supporting Virgin Media O2's mission to be a more customer-first business. We see continued demand for our Industry X capabilities, which grew strong double [indiscernible]. We are working with one of the world's leading consumer products companies on a transformation of its manufacturing practices to achieve energy savings. We are developing a comprehensive program to collect and analyze energy consumption data from their production plans and use data-driven analytics to identify energy savings and greenhouse gas reduction opportunities. We are also helping to track energy efficiency gains and deliver value through operational improvements in the manufacturing process. As clients progress on their total enterprise reinvestment journeys, talent is at the forefront. We are working with an international consumer goods and services provider in the European market on a digital transformation of its core human resources organization and talent acquisition processes. We will design and implement an approach that includes program management, process design, training and development and additional services. Together, we will create greater efficiencies in the human resources function, leading to a data-driven culture focused on better employee experiences. Now stepping back, our strategy is to be at the center of our clients' business and help them continuously reinvent themselves to reach new levels of performance and to set themselves apart as leaders in their industries. And our clients are at different starting points. All are interested in AI, and particularly generative AI. But most recognize the work ahead of them to get their data, people and processes ready for AI. To reinvent requires a strong modern digital core. And as they embark on this journey, clients are looking to us for unmatched global scale, deep industry and functional knowledge, breadth of services from strategy and consulting to technology to managed services. With that context, I want to turn to generative AI and AI more broadly. No previous technology wave has captured the intention of leaders and the general public as fast as gen AI. We are now embarking on the age of AI, and companies will need to reinvent how they operate with AI at the core. And it is also early. Think of it as the cloud over a decade ago. Foundation models and products based on them are still maturing with many products announced but fewer at the general availability stage and ready for wide deployment. And with our position as the largest partner with most of the major technology companies, we are at the center of helping our clients navigate their choices in the evolving landscape. We've been investing in AI for years. And so while it is early days, we see generative AI as a key piece of the digital core and a big catalyst for even bigger and bolder total enterprise reinvention going forward. In fact, in a survey of global executives that we completed just last week, 97% of executives said gen AI will be transformative to their company and industry and 67% of organizations are planning to increase their level of spending in technology are prioritizing investments in data and AI. Our approach to AI is clear. Just as we have successfully done with cloud, we are investing to take an early lead and position for the opportunity ahead. Last week, we announced a $3 billion investment in AI, a big step to accelerate our clients' reinvention journey, which includes us doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 strong, including the expansion of our center for advanced AI that today has over 1,600 generative AI experts bringing new assets such as our AI navigator for enterprise to life and developing new GenAI-powered industry solutions. And across this all, we are leading with responsible AI to be the most trusted source in helping our clients mitigate the risks as they drive value. And this isn't just about tomorrow. We have sold over 100 generative AI products -- projects over the last four months. Let me give you a flavor of these across a few industries. We are working with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, a Japan-based subsidiary of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings to improve customer service by using generative AI and simplify operations for accident response. The generative AI solution will draw from the company's knowledge base, including policy causes and related laws and regulations, which will generate appropriate response plans in a timely manner, dramatically improving the accuracy and speed of explanations to customers. We're working with a global broadcast company to explore how generative AI can be used to drive audience engagement and growth through deeper and more personalized customer experiences. Together, we recently launched testing that leverages generative AI and large language models to explore how we can automatically create content for the company's customer-facing platforms. The content will help enhance engagement, grow the consumer base across new coverage areas and channels. We believe it will demonstrate how generative AI can be used to create content at scale for a wide variety of experiences and events. We are working with [Linda Basel] (ph) Industries, a leader in the chemicals industry to increase its enterprise data and analytic capabilities and help unlock new value. We will develop a strategic data-led digital transformation program across multiple parts of their business and embed new capabilities in areas like sustainability, customer data, digital manufacturing and generative AI to drive more insightful and predictive decision-making. Companies are coming to us for help with the strategy in the business case to understand how and where to apply AI, and gen AI specifically, to get their digital core in shape, to help assess which ecosystem partners and models to use, to rewire their processes to be AI-driven, to upgrade and reskill their talent with new ways of working and to navigate the risks and challenges responsibly. In short, we believe clients need our full range of services and we are well positioned to be the leading trusted AI partner for the enterprise as they move from exploration to experimentation to reinvention. Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure : Thanks, Julie. Now turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.75 billion to $16.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and reflects an estimated 2% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal 2023, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 4% compared to fiscal 2022. For the full fiscal 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 8% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal 2022, which assumes an inorganic contribution of about 2%. We continue to expect business optimization costs of $800 million in fiscal 2023 to reduce EPS by $0.96. The gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies will increase EPS by $0.38. Our guidance for full year 2023 excludes these impacts. For adjusted op margin, we now expect fiscal year 2023 to be 15.4%, a 20 basis point expansion over fiscal 2022 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal 2022. We now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $11.52 to $11.63 or 8% to 9% growth over fiscal 2022 results. For the full fiscal 2023, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion. We now expect property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O’Conor: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Let's dive in on the Strategy and Consulting. I know it was a high single-digit decline this quarter just looking back at your comments from last quarter. I think that came in a little bit softer than you expected, but then also called out many new projects coming in related to gen AI and other technologies. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of what's changed, what that evolution looks like and kind of what's your confidence level in the time horizon that we'll see Strategy and Consulting improve over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. Thanks, Lisa. So I'll first give some color on that. So, the big difference in our expectations from last quarter and where we ended up really was all in the small deals. And we saw a further -- they came in lower than, and we saw that extend to Europe and the Growth Markets. Now that was both in S&C and systems integration. But that's the big reason that we have a difference in sort of where we thought where we would be this quarter. Now our job is to continue to pivot to higher -- where there is higher growth, and we're working on that in digital manufacturing, supply chain, data and AI. But that will take a little time. And what we're seeing is that, there's a lot of extensions going on in small deals, but it's the newer small projects, while at the same time, we continue to have very strong bookings and interest and huge opportunity in transformation. So I think our clients are kind of holding back on the small stuff and doing the bigger stuff, which obviously converts to revenue differently. But you see where Strategy and Consulting makes a big difference there, like in the DuPont example that I gave in the script where you have to have so much expertise in the industry, as well as the functions, as well as technology. What that means is that, it is going to take a little while for the turnaround. And we're not going to go to next year because we really want to see how Q4 evolves, and KC will give a little bit of color on how we are thinking about our Q4. And what I would also say is that, things like gen AI are a big opportunity, but it is early. So we did in the last four months 100 projects. That represents about $100 million in sales. That's kind of the average size of those projects where it is. And so, we're going to continue to pivot there, but it just takes a little bit of time. So why don't I let KC give you a little color on how we're thinking about Q4.\nKC McClure: Yes. Great. Thanks, Julie. Yes. So let me just kind of maybe step back and look at Q4 and the overall guidance for the full year. So first, I did mention this, but I just want to -- just reiterate that we are on track for our business optimization actions. So we're going to do about $800 million of cost for the full year 2023. Additional color is that, for Q4, as we look at bookings, we think they'll be about the same as what we did in Q3 of this year and have about the same complexion. Julie talked a bit about small deals. What I will tell you in terms of our revenue guidance for Q4, which is 2% to 6%. At the top end of our revenue guidance, that reflects some improvement in small deal performance, while the bottom end allows for some further deterioration. And we commented also in our scripts about CMT. And so, within our overall range of 2% to 6%, we do allow for CMT to get a little bit worse. And then lastly, to bring it on home as it relates to North America, because these two factors do impact North America performance in the context of our overall 2% to 6% range for the quarter. North America, which was 2% growth this quarter, it would likely be flat around the midpoint of our guidance range and it reflects a slight decline at the bottom of our range. And as Julie mentioned, obviously, we will give you more color, as I always do on next year when we get into September, and we'll see how Q4 plays out.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. And then maybe for my follow-up, maybe a more strategic question. I mean, Julie, you talked a lot about gen AI in the prepared remarks, particularly around the revenue opportunities that you're seeing in your clients. But can you give your view on how you see gen AI impacting the IT services industry overall? Like a lot of people make an analogy to sort of the impact of offshoring on the industry and sort of other big sort of step function changes to the operations and the kind of composition and the way IT services is done. Can you kind of give your latest perspective on that, how you see it affecting Accenture and your industry more broadly? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. Yes. And I think another good analogy actually, maybe even less so than the offshore is more about like SaaS, right? Because you remember when we talked about when SaaS came, what would be the opportunities. And there was a lot of worry about how SaaS would interrupt IT services. And obviously, it's been just a huge opportunity. So I think, Lisa, if you think about this, so obviously a big opportunity for us to help our clients. We see it as two other areas of opportunities. So the first is help our clients, big opportunity. The second is, the opportunity for us to improve the delivery of services to our clients, right? Now what is -- and that, we think, is a huge opportunity for us. So think about it first. In context of Managed Services every year, right, we have to find at least 10% of productivity. So we talk a lot about our platform, things like myWizard and that. That's all AI-enabled. Like just year-to-date in operations, not using gen AI, right, we have automated 13,000 jobs and then we've reskilled those people and redeployed them. Our business model requires us to get at least 10% productivity year in and year out. As we're kind of getting to the maturity of automation and AI before generative AI, we see generative AI as our ability to continue to give at least that 10% productivity year in and year out. So in the managed services area, we see that more as the ability to continue doing what we have to do as kind of the next generation of technology. Where we're super excited is in software development that is more around our systems integration and our big transformations around platforms because while we do automate there, we think gen AI may provide a real opportunity to do even more. And remember, our strategy is to deliver compressed transformation. So the more that we can find ways to deliver faster and less costly, that's going to be a big differentiator. So we're leaning in hard. At the same time, these technologies are [indiscernible] early. And so for example, we're doing a lot of experimentation now. It's really good for things like documentation, but complex integrations, being able to use them for highly architectured systems, which is what our large enterprises do. GenAI isn't there yet, right? So think it's going to take some time. We also don't yet know the cost. And one of the things we are really -- a lot of clients are looking at for us to help them with the business case because most of the studies, including our own, are all about what potentially uses of it. But because these products aren't out yet, we know that -- it's much more expensive to use gen AI, it's much more energy efficient. And so the actual ROI, so there's the art of the possible, but what's actually the return, it's still really early days. So we're very excited that we can get new kinds of productivity, particularly on things like consulting and systems integration but it's early days yet. And we are leaning in because we think it's a big opportunity for us to differentiate. And that's why we are investing $3 billion over the next three years because we think this is like another cloud first moment where we were out early, we invested at scale. The last thing I would say is, there's also an opportunity for us to use it in our own enterprise. And of course, we like -- part of our strategy is to be our own best credential. And we're prioritizing it, using it wherever we think we can use it for us and then take it to market to help our clients. So overall, we think that like prior big changes, right, first, the change to cloud, right, and before that to servers, that it always creates new opportunities as long as you have the ability to invest, like we do, you've got leading partnerships, we've just announced yesterday expanded partnerships with all of the three big cloud providers; and you have that agile innovation mindset that says embrace change and move fast.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you and good morning both. I guess…\nJulie Sweet: Good morning, Ashwin.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hi. Can you hear me?\nJulie Sweet: Yes.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Okay. Sorry. I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more information. I know you said that you'll comment specifically on fiscal 2024 after -- in September as you normally do. But that seems to be one of the primary questions that people are asking. So more about the framework of how you're going about the planning process for that, just given that there are so many moving parts when we kind of think of macro, when we think of AI, when we think of headcount trends, the tough comps in the first half. Maybe just kind of framework that for us and that would be quite helpful.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. So just a few things, Ashwin. So first of all, the most important thing right now just as a framework is, stay close to our clients, and really understand. And the thing is, our clients do need ways to get value in the short term as well as to transform. And so, we're working hard on finding new ways to get value to them faster. That's where the gen AI, for example, comes in. And so, over the next quarter, we're going to be developing new opportunities, new campaigns, new ways of pushing out our investments in gen AI to help us address the small deal pressure that we're seeing. We don't have a crystal ball that is going to say what the economy is going to do, how fast clients are going to get comfortable. Because you remember, we saw this over this quarter to more industries, including industries that are doing well. There's just a level of caution right now. And so, how we're looking at it is certain things we can't control, focus on not only doing the big large transformational deals, but finding new ways to develop returns faster, which is why the work we're doing on gen AI is so important. And you're seeing that kind of early focus with 100 projects in four months. So we're going to keep doing that. Secondly is, stay focused on those transformational deals, right? This provides a base level of resilience in our business. So we've got to absolutely try to do -- maximize the small deals, but it is really important that we continue to be the transformation partner of choice. And that is where bringing together all of these services and making sure that we've got the right proposition is super important. So that is a core part of our strategy. And so that's really how we're thinking about it.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you for that. And I guess the next question is with regard to hiring expectations. And there's a near-term aspect to that and the longer term so let me ask both. Near term, just kind of given what you said with regards to macro and so on and, of course, the headcount cuts announced a couple of quarters back, what should we expect in the next one or two quarters? And the longer-term question is, with AI, do you think that headcount growth dissociates from rev growth trends over time?\nJulie Sweet: Let me just take the second one first, right, is, again -- and we've been talking about this for years, right, because AI has been such a big part of our strategy and automation, right, is that we will continue to manage it just like I talked about in my last answer, like where we've already automated 13,000 jobs this quarter and we've reskilled. And so, we will continue to manage that headcount as a result of AI in the way that we've been doing it for years. So no real change in that because we have a digital enterprise system that looks at what we need and sales. And what's really core is that we can reskill people as they are being freed up, and then we can adjust how much we have to hire. And of course, with attrition that in our industry is high relative to other industries, it gives us a lot of flexibility over time to get that people hiring right. So that's how I would think about it. And then for the way that we're going to hire, we saw a year-over-year increase of about 3% over last year. 11 consecutive quarters of 91% utilization. So you should just expect that every quarter we're going to manage carefully that headcount based on where we see the growth and to do that well. And I think we've proven our ability to do that.\nKC McClure: That's right. And I would just add just maybe on Q4, in particular. As Julie talked about, we did not add any heads really between -- any people between Q2 and Q3, which is what we expected. And then just Q4, we don't really see a need to grow our overall headcount as we continue to focus on the automation and reskilling that Julie talked about.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Hi. Thank you so much. Good morning, guys. I just want -- I think you went through the small deal outlook to Lisa and Ashwin's question. So how about large deals? Can that momentum continue? I think you're up from about 17 to 26 large deals year-over-year. So just curious about...\nJulie Sweet: Yes, large deal momentum is continuing. Yes.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Yes. So yes, -- no, I'm just going to ask that, how does that look going into the fourth quarter here? And are signed deals converting on time. My follow-up to that.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. So as KC said earlier, our bookings are going to be about the same, and that includes a lot of momentum in large deals, right? So we saw 26 clients with bookings over $100 million this quarter. We're ahead of last year by 11 at this point. We can see -- continue to see that momentum. And we're actually really excited about the demand there, right? Because as you can imagine, things like gen AI are just accelerating the ability to say, \"Hey, we have to do bigger deals.\" And by the way, that may be impacting some of what we're seeing on the smaller deals because we do see more excitement about -- because the thing is the problem with gen AI for most companies is if you don't have the data, you can't use it. And so that gets you right back to the big transformations of your digital core. KC, anything to add?\nKC McClure: No, I think that's it.\nTien-Tsin Huang : So on the AI front, you did mention, I think, the cloud-first. As you draw that parallel when you guys -- I think that was three years ago, you did a $3 billion cloud first investment. That's paid off very well for you. So I'm curious, do you expect a similar return here on the $3 billion you're putting into AI? How should we measure that? Or is it going to perhaps convert differently in terms of the returns?\nJulie Sweet: Tien-Tsin, that's a great clever way to try to get us to talk about more of the future. But what I would say is, we've got a great track record of investing and getting a great return. And so, we think that it's going to pay off well.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Yes, no, I like [indiscernible] and the coincidence of similarity there. Thank you, guys.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hi. Thanks, guys. Just wanted to start actually picking up a little bit on Tien-Tsin's question around the larger deals. It sounds like that's going to persist the strength there in Q4. And I think that will be at least a few quarters in a row at that point of those larger deals showing relative strength. Can you just talk just qualitatively about to what extent those provide a foundation for top line growth in fiscal 2024? I would assume that those deals generally ramp to full run within, what, two to three quarters or so?\nKC McClure: So in terms of what you should think about on our larger deals, they really do -- it really does vary in terms of how they fill in over the quarters going into next year and sometimes depending on what the work is, particularly in managed services, and there's larger deals, they can go out -- they can go into another fiscal year. So that's no real change in what we have experienced in terms of how the bookings fill in by the -- what I would say, the sales category size. What you're seeing is that, we do have a good foundation as we look out, right? And we've had a good foundation throughout this year everything that we've been booking in the transformational deals. But what really does also matter as you get into the year and then into -- closer to the quarters is how do you fill in with some of the smaller bookings.\nJulie Sweet: If said another way, if small deals don't come back. We're going to have -- that's an important part of sort of understanding, which is why we want to see how Q4 works out before we look at next year.\nJason Kupferberg: Totally understand, totally understand. Let me switch over to bookings just for a follow-up. And by the way, thank you for the level set on AI. It's not too surprising that just a tiny fraction of your total bookings given how it's still early days. But I wanted to actually ask on the Managed Services bookings. Just curious versus your internal expectations how those came in, in the quarter. I know they can be pretty lumpy. But it does seem like looking ahead to Q4, the managed services bookings will slow a bit on an LTM basis just based on some of the commentary that you provided around Q4 bookings mix.\nKC McClure: Yes. So let me just talk about overall Managed Services. Yes, we're very pleased overall with our Managed Services bookings, right? They were up 9% this quarter and they're up 22% on a year-to-date basis. So we're very pleased with the bookings overall and the result of revenue, which continue to be very strong. We also have a very strong book-to-bill with the trailing of 1.1. And when I talked about Q4, Jason, we'll have about the same complexion of bookings in terms of the breakout of type of work. And I would -- and I will highlight just the continued strength within our bookings of our operations business, which, again, Julie had a lot of great examples in her script. It really is around when clients are focusing on digitizing their core, cutting costs of operations business is a differentiator and obviously very strategic.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, KC.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Also, just kind of a follow-up on generative AI and the understanding and timing. I get that it's early, but the big question everybody is asking is how long will it take before it moves the needle in bookings and revenue? Is that a couple of years out still? Or is that the time frame and the rapidness of the use of the technology should push it earlier than a normal technology wave?\nJulie Sweet: Well, Bryan, I think in general, we think gen AI is going to go faster than, say, cloud, right, which took more like a decade. I would focus on -- so first of all, we're being very rigorous when we talk about gen AI, because we're really saying like what are the actual gen AI. The big growth, we think, is going to be in all the companies that then have to get their data done faster. And we're not lumping that together. And so, I don't know what others are going to do, but we're really being very pure in saying like, \"Hey, this is pure gen AI.\" And if you think about where companies are, our research shows like only 5% to 10% of companies are mature right now with data and AI, and they're the ones that are really going to be able to use gen AI at scale. About -- we just had this research done that came in last week that hasn't been published yet. About 50% of companies have not started on their data or AI journey and everything in between -- some are good in data but not AI. They're having a hard time to scale. So where we think growth is going to come particularly next year, the bigger growth is going to be not in like the pure gen AI, but it's going to be in helping companies finish getting their end-of-life data migrated to the cloud. Because you need your data in the cloud, right? It's going to come in the data strategy and the -- all the governance and getting it architected while some of the stuff around gen AI gets sorted out. So for example, like cost is not there yet. And how do you take data from one cloud and there's cost to take it and put it another cloud. All of that, we're going to be working with our clients and our technology partners to really create the right business cases. But the growth we think in the near term is going to be from accelerating the digital core. And that's why we feel really good about the bigger transformational deals continuing next year because there's so much work to do.\nBryan Keane : No, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, are there M&A opportunities of scale to grow in generative AI? Or is it still early in the days there, so there's not really a lot of M&A you can do?\nJulie Sweet: It's really early. I mean, there's a lot of companies popping up as we know, and we're going to continue to scan. But one of the great things that we have is the ability to train, right? We've already trained in the last quarter another 1,000 people in gen AI. And by the way, since 2019, we have been requiring all of our 700,000 people to take a course on AI. So we have a really good baseline. And so, we think that it's going to be a lot like when we move to digital, a lot of organic. And this is where we're so competitively well positioned because we have great credentials in how we have trained our own table to rotate.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Rod Bourgeois of DeepDive Equity Research.\nRod Bourgeois : Hi, guys. You sometimes comment about pricing and contract profitability. So I wanted to ask if you could provide an update on pricing and contract terms, particularly on a like-for-like basis in both consulting and outsourcing. Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yes. Rod, so let me just comment on pricing and what we're seeing. So just let me start with as a reminder, when we talk about pricing that we define that as contractility or the margin on the work that we sell. And so what we're seeing in pricing is after five quarters of consecutive improvement in pricing, we mentioned last quarter that it's stabilized. And this quarter, we see the pricing is lower in some areas of our business. I continue to be very pleased with how we are managing pricing, particularly navigating the more challenging wage environment that we've experienced over the last few years. So very pleased with how we're performing in pricing and our overall contract profitability that we have this year. .\nRod Bourgeois : Okay. Great. And then maybe just to wrap up, as the consulting business has slowed some here, can you talk about what demand themes have slowed the most and maybe the outlook for those themes, I mean, maybe across your various solution areas, like cloud and ERP and security and data. Are there certain of the themes that have slowed the most? Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Look, on our consulting on the systems integration side, it's really more a tale about the small deals, right? So what we're seeing is that, sort of some of the small things versus the bigger, so a lot of the big transformations are continuing. So that's -- we're not seeing -- I mean, basically anything around the digital core, moving to cloud, all of that's going really well at the bigger levels. It's more about starting new projects right now. And so -- which is why we expect that demand to come back when people are less cautious.\nRod Bourgeois : Okay. Thank you.\nKatie O’Conor: Operator we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap-up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will come from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow-up questions from me here. First, on AI and AI-related projects. How do you envision pricing, project constructs, terms and statements of work to change with the introduction of and adoption of generative AI generally?\nJulie Sweet: I mean, we're not anticipating any big changes in those areas.\nJames Faucette: Got it, got it. And then you mentioned, in reference to generative AI, like the [B&A] (ph) opportunities are pretty small right now and really nascent. But how are you thinking about B&A more generally going forward? Should we expect ongoing sustained and pretty stable levels of inorganic contribution? And -- or should we expect there to be some changes as expectations and emphasis shifts a little bit more to AI.\nJulie Sweet: Well, no, a couple of things. So first of all, no shift in how we view inorganic, which is a core part of our business model, right? So we expect to get about 2% of our revenue growth from this year from inorganic, and this has been a stable part of our strategy. And I just want to be clear that the shift to AI is just -- let's go back to total enterprise reinvention. What are clients doing? They are reinventing every part using tech data and AI. So when you look at our growth priorities, cloud, both the move to the cloud, but also cloud-based platforms, all growing very significantly, right, at the top level overall. And so, it's about building a digital core. And then the opportunity to take AI is to then reinvent the processes and the ways of working, which is, by the way, a huge opportunity for Accenture because we're not just about the technology. Our strength is in being able to do all of that. So I think it's really important that it's not an emphasis shift on AI. It's a rapidly accelerated opportunity because companies who were kind of resistant or not focused on it are now focusing on it. So I think that's important. Then the last piece is we will -- our focus is not going to suddenly in M&A be around just data and AI. And in fact, we think that there's going to be much more organic because there isn't a lot out there. But we use AI, right, to scale things like consulting, industry expertise, digital expertise. We've done that for digital manufacturing, supply chain. We also use it to get into new areas. So I'm super excited that yesterday we announced that we acquired Answer Advisors, which is a primarily US-focused, North America-focused company and capital projects. That's a really small business today in the U.S. and we just acquired a great company with 900 professionals in a market that has an $88 billion addressable market in North America, growing really well. That's a whole new area of net new growth for our North America business. So we use our ability to invest, right, to scale great things and continuously seed new areas of growth for Accenture. And you've seen us do that over and over again. We did it with Song, we did it with Industry X and digital manufacturing. We're now in supply chain and we're moving into capital projects. So that is just a huge advantage as you think about, not just the next couple of years, but growth over the decade for Accenture.\nJames Faucette: That’s great color. Thank you so much.\nJulie Sweet: Great. Well, thanks, everyone. In closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support and all our people for what you are doing for our clients and for each other every day. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Look forward to being back together in a quarter.\nOperator: Thank you.

Welcome to Accenture's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatie O'Conor: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full fiscal 2023 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I am Katie O’Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results; KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2024. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we will discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those factors set forth in today’s news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie, and everyone joining us. And thank you to the approximately 733,000 Accenture people, who have worked hard to be at the center of our client's business across our fiscal year ‘23. Our laser focus on creating 360-degree value for our clients and all our stakeholders is reflected in our overall strong results for the year. With record bookings of $72 billion, we had a record 106 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in FY ‘23, up from 100 last year. We now have 300 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships, an increase of 33 from last year, demonstrating yet again the depth and breadth of our capabilities and the trust our clients have in us. We delivered revenues of $64 billion for the year, representing 8% growth in local currency, while continuing to take market share. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 9%, while continuing to significantly invest in our business and our people with capital deployed of over $2.5 billion across 25 acquisitions, $1.3 billion in R&D assets, platforms, and industry solutions, and $1.1 billion invested in the training and development of our people. And we generated free cash flow of $9 billion, allowing us to return over $7 billion of cash to shareholders. And we are delivering a little ahead of schedule on our business optimization actions we announced in March to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience. We also continue to attract, retain, and inspire outstanding people through our talent strategy. We're making progress toward our commitment to Net Zero by 2025, and we invested in our communities to help ensure we have vibrant places where we work and live. I will give more detail a little later in the call. Taking a step back, coming off two fiscal years of double-digit growth and a truly extraordinary FY ‘22, we are very pleased with our FY ‘23 results and the moves we have made to optimize our business. We are also rapidly taking an early leadership position in gen AI, which will be an important part of the reinvention of our clients in the next decade. Last quarter, we shared that we had sold 100 projects with roughly $100 million in sales over the prior four months. Demand accelerated in Q4 with another approximately $200 million in gen AI sales to bring our total to over $300 million for the year. We also are embracing the use of gen AI in our own delivery of services and the way we work across Accenture. As we reflect on how our market has developed over the last year, we and our clients have had to navigate a macro environment that is tougher than we anticipated at the beginning of FY ‘23. While it's played out differently across markets and industries, we have seen greater caution globally, with lower discretionary spend, slower decision-making, and in particular for us, a significant impact from the challenges the comm, media, and tech industries have faced. For example, in Q4, where we grew 4% in local currency, if we exclude CMT, we grew 7% globally, 6% in North America, 9% in Europe, and 8% in growth markets. Against that backdrop, as we enter FY ‘24, we remain laser focused on creating value for our clients. While the pace of spending has changed, the fundamentals have not. All strategies continue to lead to technology. And companies will need to reinvent every part of their enterprise using tech, data, and AI to optimize operations and accelerate growth. To do so, they must build a digital core. We are continuing to see significant demand in areas like cloud migration and modernization, modern ERP and data and AI, and the emergence of gen AI in particular, all of which represent areas of great opportunity. And it's still early. For example, we estimate that only 40% of workloads are in the cloud today, only one-third of clients have modernized their ERP platforms, and less than 10% have what we define as mature data and AI capabilities. We believe helping build a strong digital core and then using it to reinvent will be the drivers of our growth. Our ability to advise, shape, and deliver value-led transformation, leveraging the breadth of our services and industry expertise from strategy and consulting, to technology, to our managed services across industries and geographic markets, along with our privileged position with our ecosystem partners, is what makes Accenture unique. And you can see this unique positioning in the number of our Diamond clients, clients who turn to us for large-scale transformation. Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. And thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which were within our guided range and aligned to our expectations, completing another strong year for Accenture. Our results reflect the diversity of our business and once again illustrate our ability to run our business with discipline and deliver significant value for our shareholders. So let me begin by summarizing a few highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 4% local currency, driven by high-single or double-digit growth in five of our 13 industries. As we called out last quarter, we expected increased pressure in our CMT industry group and we saw declines of 12% local currency this quarter. As Julie mentioned, excluding CMT, our business grew 7% globally. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.71, reflecting 4% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, an increase of 20 basis points over Q4 last year, and includes significant -- continued significant investments in our people and our business. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.2 billion, driven by very strong DSO management. Now, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $16.6 billion for the quarter, a 10% decline in local currency, with an overall book to bill of 1. Consulting bookings were $8.5 billion with a book to bill of 1. Managed services bookings were $8.2 billion with a book to bill of 1. Turning now to revenues, revenues for the quarter were $16 billion, a 4% increase in both US dollar and local currency, representing continued market share gains. Now, as a reminder, we assessed market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public company competitors, which represent about a third of our addressable market. We used a consistent methodology to compare our financial results and theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the data of their last publicly available results on a rolling four quarter basis. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.2 billion, a decline of 2% in both U.S. dollar and local currency. Managed services revenues were $7.8 billion, up 10% in both U.S. dollars and local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services grew mid-single-digits, operations grew high-single-digits, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single-digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 1% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, health, and utilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in communications and media, software and platforms, banking and capital markets, and high tech. In Europe, revenues grew 7% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, industrial and public service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany and France. In growth markets, we delivered 6% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in chemicals and natural resources, industrial and energy. Revenue growth was driven by Japan. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.4%, compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.8%, compared with 10.2% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.7%, compared to 7.1% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q4, we recorded $472 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 290 basis points and EPS by $0.56, and also impacted our tax rates. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.9% adjusted operating margin and an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in Q4 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.4%, compared with an effective tax rate of 24.6% for the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted diluting earnings per share were $2.71, compared with EPS of $2.60 in the fourth quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 42 days, compared to 42 days last quarter, and 43 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $180 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $9 billion, compared with $7.9 billion at August 31 last year. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.2 million shares for $1 billion, an average price of $312.35 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $706 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on November 15, a 15% increase over last year, and approved $4 billion of additional share repurchase authority. Now, I'd like to take a moment to summarize the year, as we've navigated a challenging macro environment and successfully executed our business to deliver or exceed all aspects of our original guidance that we provided last September on an adjusted basis. We delivered $72.2 billion in new bookings, reflecting 5% growth in local currency. Revenue of $64.1 billion for the year, reflecting strong growth of 8% local currency, and reflecting continued market share gains. Before I continue for the full-year, we recorded $1.1 billion in costs associated with business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 170 basis points, and EPS by $1.28. We also recognized a gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating margin of 15.4%, a 20-basis point expansion over FY ‘22. Adjusted earnings per share was $11.67, reflecting 9% growth over FY ‘22 EPS. Free cash flow of $9 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.3. And with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $7.2 billion of cash to shareholders, while investing approximately $2.5 billion across 25 acquisitions. In closing, we remain committed to delivering on our enduring shareholder value proposition, while creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders, clients, our people, our shareholders, partners, and our communities. And now let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. Let me now bring to life for you the demand we saw from our clients this quarter as they build their digital core and reinvent. We saw this demand across markets and industries. Our cloud momentum continued with very strong double-digit growth in Q4, as clients prioritized building a strong and secure foundation for reinvention. We're partnering with a multinational financial services company on a cloud-based transformation to deliver enhanced, personalized, and secure customer experiences, and to increase employee productivity. Together, we're developing an integrated hosting strategy that unifies their hybrid multi-cloud landscape and lays the foundation for their digital transformation over the next decade. This partnership enables innovative solutions across all bank functions and is backed by a trusted and secure foundation that supports advanced workloads and complex AI and data solutions. Working from a compliant cloud platform will safeguard the customer data, privacy, and financial assets, positioning the organization to stand out for its innovation and customer focus. And we are supporting a U.S.-based energy company on a total enterprise reinvention strategy to unify different technologies and business processes around a common digital core. We'll help leading the deployment of a cloud-based IT platform that integrates customer management, finance, HR, supply chains, asset management, and operations, improving the ability to assess and optimize operational performance. We also are helping manage and integrate the responsibilities and activities of the vendors involved in the project, standardize data from legacy applications, and enable company employees to understand and manage the new processes and technologies. Data-driven decision-making will be improved, allowing the company to cultivate better collaboration within their business, helping them operate more efficiently and better serve their customers. We are partnering with Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan to accelerate their path to becoming a world-class bottler and data-driven organization. The partnership includes establishing an innovative joint venture of significant scale of approximately 870 people that will accelerate transforming their digital core, optimizing their enterprise operations, leveraging the power of cloud, data, and AI to increase the value delivered from their core business functions. In support of their broader strategic business plan, Accenture will provide specialized talent, industry expertise, and leading-edge technology automation and managed services to help Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan adopt a strategy of continuous enterprise reinvention. Data and AI are an important part of building the digital core, and we see that work both embedded in our larger transformations, as you just heard, and in work focused on data and AI modernization. Accenture Federal Services is helping the defense health agency operate and enhance the Joint Medical Common Operating Picture platform by implementing data synchronization across multiple network domains and near real-time collaboration and information sharing, we will provide a comprehensive picture into Department of Defense medical assets. This increases visibility into unit health, equipment, and supplies and allows for faster and more informed decision-making. We are a strategic partner for the Saudi Data and AI Authority to boost the Kingdom's transformation to a data-driven economy and help the Kingdom become a world leader in generation and deployment of AI technology. We're working closely with Sadiya to support cutting-edge research, promote digital innovation in public life, and boost national capabilities and talent. We're especially pleased with the double-digit growth we have in the Middle East, a small, but growing part of our business. Security is essential to a digital core, and we had very strong double-digit growth in our security business in Q4. We're working with a major energy network in the U.K. on the transformation of its cybersecurity systems. We will provide an entire managed service for their cybersecurity capability, including migration to a more powerful security platform, continuous and active threat monitoring, and response services, as well as security tools management. Our solutions will help provide improved security, reduce exposure to potential global security threats, and ultimately better safeguard the safe delivery of gas to millions of U.K. homes and businesses. As clients continue to reimagine and prioritize the customer experience, Song delivered strong double-digit growth in Q4. We are helping smart Europe, maker of the next generation of smart vehicles, products, and services of the iconic brand from smart Automobile Company -- Co Limited., a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz and Geely. We are helping them reinvent car shopping by creating an ecosystem that supports a seamless, fully digital-driven buying experience. By putting data at the core, the system allows personalization of the customer journey, makes recommendations based on real-time data, and includes enhanced offerings such as extended insurance coverage. It will help smart Europe reposition its brand and support the launch of its intelligent, fully electrical car lines. We also continue to see demand for our supply chain in Industry X capabilities, the next digital frontier, which grew strong double-digits in Q4. In Industry X, we are partnering with a global chemical and materials company on a digital transformation of their manufacturing core and commercial capabilities. Through our Industry X capabilities, we have built a unified connected worker platform for operators, maintenance technicians, and job planners, along with a cloud-based data lake to help generate insight from disparate sources of manufacturing data. The program is already live in dozens of manufacturing sites and is expected to create significant revenue growth over the next few years for our clients. And in supply chain, we have partnered with a large global food and beverage conglomerate to strengthen supply chain resilience, so consumers have continued access to their products in stores and online. By creating a digital twin of its supply chain, we will develop stress test models to help identify supply disruptions with the highest risk before they occur. Across these examples, you can see our unique capabilities of both being a technology powerhouse, along with our industry and functional expertise from strategy and consulting to technology, to managing services -- managed services to help our clients reinvent. Now let's turn to generative AI. As a reminder, last quarter we announced a $3 billion investment in AI. While still in the early stages, gen AI technology is maturing rapidly and we believe it will be a significant source of value for us and our clients over time. We now have about 300 projects and I want to share a little color in how this demand is coming through. We have projects across all our industries with banking, public service, consumer goods, and utilities leading an activity. Clients are doing a variety of different types of work from strategy and use case implementations to tech enablement, to scaling, to model customization, tuning and training, to talent and responsible AI. For example, we're working with a multinational telecom company, Telefonica Brazil, also known as Vivo, to deliver a generative AI solution that helps its agents respond quicker to landlords' queries about property rental for network towers. The application quickly reads landlords' queries and proposes a set of actions to help fulfill requests, reducing the time it takes agents to respond. It also structures the response with a set of relevant answers to increase the response quality and ensure all queries are answered in a helpful manner. The solution has already reduced agent response time by 30% and increased the user experience score by 66%. Some of the key ingredients of our success in gen AI are: first, ecosystem partnerships. As always, we are starting with deep relationships and leadership in the ecosystem, from the hyperscalers to the model builders to the startups and academics. It is important to emphasize that we are early in the maturity of gen AI for enterprise, and our depth, experience, and insight on these [plant-forwards] (ph) is essential to guiding our clients. Second, Talent. We start with a deep technical knowledge and understanding of AI and gen AI and blend that with our industry and functional expertise to know how to reinvent across the enterprise, including processes and operating models, bringing together the depth and breadth of our expertise. And that is where Accenture is different, building the bridge from as is to the future. And we have already trained approximately 600,000 of our people in the fundamentals of AI. Now with generative AI, the pace and impact is growing rapidly. And we are now taking a further step to equip more than 250,000 people and using new AI tools equitably, sustainably and without bias. And with investments in our AI Academy focused on deep AI and gen AI specialization, we are also progressing towards our goal of doubling our deeply skilled data and AI practitioners from 40,000 to 80,000. Third, responsible AI is essential. At Accenture, we have an industry-leading responsible AI compliance program, which is embedded in how we use and deliver AI. And we're using the experience and lessons learned by us to help our clients build out their own responsible AI program, which is necessary to address the risks and get the full value from AI. Finally, we are embracing gen AI across our services, developing new cutting-edge tools and solutions, inventing gen AI in the way we work. Our approach takes into account where the technology is today, the need to deploy it responsibly, and the recognition that we do work in highly complex environments. While all companies want to explore and understand gen AI, what we find is that clients who are more mature digitally want to go faster, while others would like to test the waters with proofs of concepts and synthetic data, and others prefer to wait until they have built more of their modern digital core. The extent and pace of this generative AI progression will become more clear over the coming quarters as the technology and the market continue to mature and progress. Now turning to our people, who have made all of this happen. Core to our success is our ability to attract and retain and inspire our outstanding talent. Essential to our success is our robust talent strategy, and in particular, our ability to attract diverse talent and our Net Better Off approach to retaining our great talent. We continue to lead in our ability to attract people with different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different lived experiences. These differences ensure that we’ve -- have and attract the cognitive diversity to deliver a variety of perspectives, observations, and insights, which are critical to drive the innovation needed to reinvent. Our success is reflected in our being the top-scoring company on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the second year in a row, and we also earned the number one position on the Refinitiv Global Diversity and Inclusion Index for the fourth time in six years. This index ranks over 15,000 organizations globally and identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces. Our talent strategy includes inspiring and retaining our best talent through our Net Better Off approach. We want our people to feel they are Net Better Off for working at Accenture. This strategy has four dimensions, focusing on people feeling healthy and well, physically, emotionally, and financially, feeling connected with a sense of belonging, feeling their work as purpose and filing feeling they are continuing to build market-relevant skills. This year, for example, our people participated in approximately 40 million training hours, and we were a recipient of the Brandon Hall Gold Award for best benefits, wellness, and well-being programs. Building on our longstanding commitment to the environment, we are pleased to have hit a significant milestone on our path to Net Zero, approaching -- seeing 100% renewable electricity across all of our Accenture offices. I will wrap up with a comment on our work and communities. Vibrant communities are important to our business success, and therefore we continue to prioritize creating value in these communities around the world. For example, Accenture is helping to welcome refugees, recognizing how they enrich our communities with their courage, strength, and talent. In June 2023, on World Refugee Day, we committed to partner with organizations to help skill and support an estimated 16,000 refugee job seekers and migrants and to hire 100 refugees in Europe over the next three years. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal '24, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.85 billion to $16.45 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately positive 2.5%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal ‘23 and reflects an estimated negative 2% to positive 2% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year ‘24, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be flat compared to fiscal ‘23. For the full fiscal ‘24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 2% to 5% growth in local currency over fiscal ‘23, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 2%. We expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal '24 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. The following guidance for full-year fiscal 2024 excludes these impacts. For adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year ‘24 to be 15.5% to 15.7%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal ‘23 results. We expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal ‘23. We expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '24 to be in the range of $11.97 to $12.32 or 3% to 6% growth over adjusted fiscal ‘23 results. For the full fiscal ‘24, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. And with that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thank you. Good morning, Julie and Casey, I just wanted to dig in first on CMT, if you don't mind. Just curious there if the challenges are -- have changed at all, has it isolated just a few clients or is it more broad-based? And what's the strategy here to turn demand around? Are you seeing any green shoots there? Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Great, thanks Tien-Tsin. So it is broad-based, I mean, we have -- we're seeing it broad-based across the globe and across clients. And we continue to see those challenges. So we do think that it's going to -- we do know that it's going to develop a little bit differently based on markets. The challenges in the U.S. are more difficult. They're more focused on both technology and the technology companies and comms, whereas Europe, it's a little different, the complexion. And so, over the course of the year, we expect that the improvement will come at a little different pace depending on the market. And in terms of how we're addressing it, it's really two-fold. So first of all, we're going to continue to pivot within that industry to areas like helping within the confines of how much they are spending, trying to help them cut costs, working on things like customer service investing in more network capabilities. And what we're also doing is pivoting our business to the higher areas of growth, and you see that with acquisitions, like we did answer technologies and Industry X in the U.S., we did Flutura in India and data and AI. And so we've got a lot of areas of growth and you can see that when you take out CMT with the -- how the rest of our business is growing and it's just going to take a little time to make that pivot and that's why what you're seeing in our guidance is that we're going to build over the year as the actions we're taking to continue to pivot the business play out.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Understood on that one. Thank you. Just my quick follow-up on gen AI, I know the sales doubled there and you went through a lot of good detail. I'm just curious, is it -- are the deal sizes getting larger? Is it pulling through more large projects from what you've seen recently? I'm just curious how that might evolve here as we get into the new fiscal year?\nJulie Sweet: Sure, so at this point, and remember, when we give you gen AI numbers, we're being very clear it's pure gen AI, so we're not like, you know, sort of talking about data and all of those things. So the real gen AI projects right now are still in that sort of million dollar-ish on average range. And we expect that's going to continue for a while, right? That’s what we're seeing because there's a lot of experimentation. Now what it's doing though is leading clients to look harder at, well, where do I go faster, right, in terms of the digital core? You know, and so we started seeing a tick up, for example, in data migration, right? But it is still extremely early, but that's how we think it's going to, you know, play out over even the coming year, right, as people get more excited about it and it also points out the challenges. But keep in mind that, you know, implementing gen AI is not like, it's like, it's not easy. Entire environments need to be set up. It's quite complex, actually. So it really plays into our strengths of being able to help them understand what it takes, where their gaps are, and then how to take the next step on the journey to get there, even as we see clients being cautious, they're really focused on help us save money, so we can take those next steps.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. No, it should bode well for Accenture. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: We’ll go next to the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to, kind of, follow-up on a couple of questions there. One of the other areas that had seen some strength and seems like it's weakened a little bit has been managed services. Can you talk through, kind of, what's happening there and one of the things that we're also seeing is, hear is -- or hearing is that there's some variation in demand right now, especially geographically, maybe with Europe being a little weaker, but other markets being a little stronger. Can you just give color on managed services and what's happening geographically?\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks, James, for the question. I will -- maybe I'll start with, just kind of giving you a little bit of color on what we're seeing on managed services as it relates to guidance and just maybe broader guidance kind of overall. So I'll just start with our full-year, right? So we started with our full-year guidance, which is 2% to 5% growth for the year. I think the key part, as Julie mentioned, is that we expect that we're going to build as we go throughout the year. And you can see that in our range for Q1, which starts negative 2 and has 2 at the top end of our range. And then if you look at Q1, for the most part, what we are reflecting in our Q1 guidance is really more the same across the various dimensions of our business that we saw in Q4. And -- but we have a backdrop of a tougher compare in the first quarter of FY ’24, that's our toughest compare for the full-year. And then if you look at the full year, maybe three things to add. From a macro, we're not assuming that there's an improvement in the discretionary spend environment or the macro as we look at the year. The second on your -- to get to the type of work question, we're going to build as we go throughout the year and we see consulting for the full-year being at low-single-digit. And managed services is going to be a healthy mid to high-single-digit growth for the full-year. And then, depending on how the revenue builds, the last point would be on operating margin. We do expect to see more variability in the quarters as we go through fiscal ‘24 on our way to 10 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion for the year. So hopefully that gave you a little bit of color. Julie, if you want to talk a little bit more about specifics in managed services?\nJulie Sweet: And what I would say on managed services, managed services continue to be really important for our clients, because it's both a cost play, but also a faster digitization play. But it will play out a little bit. So, for example, at Accenture, right, we've got trust and safety and other managed services in the CMT. And so that's going to affect some of our results depending on the quarter and the compare and how things kind of roll out. So that's why what we're thinking about next year will be somewhere in the mid to high-single-digits, but we don't see a fundamental issue around managed services. In fact, we think they are a really strategic priority for many of our clients, but it will play out a little bit differently based on industries. We see less of it based on sort of market per se because clients really need the managed services.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you talk a little bit about your inorganic strategy, just what contribution has been, and particularly in light of the increased capital return program for ‘24, if we should anticipate that that will have any impact on what you guys historically have done from an inorganic contribution? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Sure. In terms of inorganic contribution, for ‘23, it was about 2% was the inorganic contribution and for ‘24, James, we're considering another about 2% in ‘24.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And, look, on our inorganic strategy remember that the way we think about it is, can we get into new areas through our inorganic, like what we did with Anser Advisory and Industry X, which is capital products. It's basically we're very small there before the acquisition, that's an $80 billion addressable market. So that's an acquisition to start to grow there. We think about it as being important to invest in our industry and functional expertise. So in France this year, we -- this last quarter, we did an insurance acquisition in strategy and consulting. And we think about it in terms of scale. So we bought a data and AI practice in terms -- in India this quarter. And so as we are pivoting to the higher areas of growth right now, a real advantage we have is the ability to leverage our investment capacity in order to do that pivot. And of course we're -- right now, we're kind of assuming 2%, but we have the ability to do more if we have the right opportunities. And so we really do think about this as a huge competitive advantage in our industry, in our ability to drive growth and to be in the hot areas of the market.\nJames Faucette: That's great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I might start on the business optimization program. Can you just give a little bit more detail in terms of what -- where exactly you are, what's completed, what remains in 2024, and maybe a little bit of more detail on how we should expect that impact to sequence in throughout fiscal ‘24? And then just remind us whether that's then the end of it and we should expect to kind of move back toward GAAP reporting at the end of ‘24?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Thanks, Lisa. So just in terms of -- just as a reminder, so we -- when we announced our business optimization program, we said it would be about $1.5 billion, and that would go through FY ‘24. So we still are saying $1.5 billion through FY ‘24. As it relates to next year, right, we expect to incur approximately $450 million. We were -- we did record $1.1 billion in FY ‘23, which is a little bit more than we expected to do in ‘23. So we were able to get a bit more into the P&L in last fiscal year '23. And I'm happy to go through the impacts on EPS, but you saw that it will be a $0.56 impact on EPS for ‘24, and I'm happy to go through some of the questions that you have. Yes. And also as we go throughout the year, the two -- we take the business optimization out of our results as we go throughout the quarters, so that doesn't -- that's not their driver for why we'll have more margin variability as we go throughout the year. And we'll see how it plays out. It really depends on the countries and different things that we have to go through in terms of process and procedures. And so we're not giving an update as we go throughout the year on the full-year estimate, but we're not breaking that up by quarter.\nLisa Ellis: Got it. Okay, okay. Great, thank you. And then maybe my follow-up, just to -- a quick follow-up on the managed services question, maybe just a little bit taking a step back, Julie, I think over the last few quarters, as we've been seeing some of the softness in strategy and consulting and this shorter duration discretionary work, you've been highlighting pretty consistently that has not really bled over into the larger transformation programs. And I just wanted to kind of ask if you could kind of update us on the latest you're seeing on that given that we saw a little bit of a slowdown in some of the managed services bookings this quarter. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Sure. I mean, what I would say is that overall -- first of all, the large transformational programs include managed services, but they also include building, like so putting new modern ERP programs in place, right? So it's not only kind of managed services just to kind of set the stage for that. And just as you think about the fundamentals, because we think of the transformation deals, managed services are often a way to pay for them. They're often also a way to go faster and modernize, but we really look at those transformational programs in the round. So when you think about the fundamentals that our clients are facing, there is more reinvention ahead than they have done so far. So huge opportunity ahead. And you see that in where they are in the cloud journey, only 40% workloads, right? We estimate less than 10% of our clients are mature in data and AI. Only a third have put in the modern ERP programs. And so as you think about what they have to do, managed services will continue to play a huge role in paying for it and in actually modernizing much of it, as well the other big implementations. We do see, however, right, when you kind of go to the market-- and by the way, that's why we're super well positioned, right? Our strategy is to be that partner and then reinvention begets more, right? So you first build the digital core and then you've got a lot of work on top of that. And that is our growth strategy. Now, if you come to what we're seeing in the market, right? So always best to hear from what's going on in the ground. Last week, I was very busy and I was with about 20 different CEOs and they had three messages, right? Tech is super important, that's number one. Number two, they already have major programs underway and they know they need to do a lot more. But number three is they're feeling cautious about the macro and we've already seen that in the small deals. But they're asking us to help them save money and be more focused right now, even on the bigger programs. And so what I would say is and that's reflected in our guidance is that, the macro is having an effect on the pace of spending right now. Now, again, plays into our strengths in terms of being able to be the reinvention partner, being able to really think about the journey and positions us super well as they navigate that macro. But that is -- the reality is that there is this sense of caution and it's bleeding over to kind of overall, overall demands.\nKC McClure: Right. And Lisa, maybe I'll just add, bookings can be lumpy, particularly in managed services. And we look at bookings -- book to bill over rolling four quarters and our goal in managed services is to be 1.2 or above. And that's exactly where we are on a four-quarter basis.\nLisa Ellis: Great. Thank you. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to ask -- go back to M&A if I could start with you, Julie. You're guiding to 2 points of M&A contribution to your full-year guidance which is consistent with sort of the past years, but the number here much bigger. 2 points is meaningfully than what it was even three or four years ago in terms of, A, the capital required to do those deals; and B, the integration therefore of the head count? And I just wanted to hear your, kind of, philosophically, it doesn't seem like 2 points can continue on for perpetuity, but just how do you think about any, kind of, balance sheet constraints or also the integration required to make sure the people side of the business -- because again, implicitly the deals are getting larger. And then as part of that, could you just speak to -- do you look at the same size deals or do you need to kind of flex up a little bit in terms of looking at larger opportunities? And then I have a follow up. Sorry about the background noise.\nKC McClure: No problem, Keith. Thanks, I'll handle the capital allocation part and I'll hand it over to Julie. So just from a capital allocation standpoint, Julie referenced this a little bit earlier, but our capital allocation framework is really durable, but it is also very flexible. So we've been able to continue to return a significant portion of our cash through dividends and share repurchases. Well over the time we've been flexing at various times the amount of money that we spend in V&A and we can continue with that framework. So just again as a focus, we had about 80% of our free cash flow return to shareholders through dividends and repurchases in FY ‘23 and we actually have a $500 million, $0.5 billion increase in our guidance baked in for next year. So just shows that our capital allocation framework can flex as needed while still doing a great return.\nJulie Sweet: And what I would say is that I'm really proud that how we do M&A is a core competency of Accenture, right? So we've now been on this journey. I helped start it when I was the general counsel. I remember that was -- I came in and they were like, we kind of need to increase this and I've done a lot of that in my prior life and what you see is that, as we've grown, we've continued to build the capabilities. We have a very mature machine around integration, but we also have an operating model where we have leaders close to the acquisitions, doing the integration. And they really do vary from very small to larger ones. We've done over $1 billion and we could do even bigger ones with our capital. The point is that, we know how to integrate and we've been doing this now for many, many years.\nKeith Bachman: Okay, fair enough and thank you, Julie. My follow-up is just how do you think about headcount for Accenture through the year? You're just kind of finishing off your risk, but how do you think about headcount as we process through FY ‘24 and I'm really thinking on an organic basis, excluding the M&A. Many thanks and that's it for me.\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks, Keith. Really what I would say is managing supply and demand. As you know, it's a core competency of ours and we're going to manage our supply skills based on wherever we see the growth. So we didn't expect that we would need to add a lot of people in -- from Q3 to Q4 as we said and that's exactly what happened. And so we're going to continue to hire for the skills that we need and we're going to focus on the automation and as Julie mentioned, the lot of re-skilling of our people.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to ask in terms of visibility that you'd say you have now in the environment relative to prior years on the outlook side. I mean, has anything changed and just maybe if you could reiterate for us where you're seeing the pockets of strength in a little bit more of a specific manner around example that customers need right now that might be -- that might buck the trend of what you typically see in a downturn macroeconomically. Just curious kind of what's fighting through the demand weakness no matter what just because it's really mission critical right now. Thanks again.\nKC McClure: Yes. Great, thanks, Darrin. In terms of visibility, right, as we sit here at the beginning of a new fiscal year, as -- we're really confident that we're taking all the right steps to successfully deliver for a full-year and as you know well, we always aim for the top part of the range. But just like every other year at this time, the back half of the year is less certain, because we'll know more when the budgets are set which is really in the back -- which is in the H2 of our year. But as we mentioned, we are going to build throughout the year and why do we say that? Well, first of all, we're confident in the steps that we're taking that Julie highlighted many examples to pivot to the higher growth areas. And we expect that we'll see that come through in the back half of the year and that's also backed up by the investments that we'll make. The second part is that we do have the revenue from the larger scale transformations. It is out there, right? And so we just need to layer in some of the new growth area work that we'll get to as we approach the back half of the year. And the last part, as you're aware, I mean, we do have the benefit of each year comparison in the back half.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And then in terms of demand, it's exactly what we've been talking about. The number one area of demand is building that digital core. So you've got clients like the financial service client I mentioned in the script that's not in the cloud at all and is basically needing to migrate to the cloud, right? Then you've got those who are in the cloud but they haven't modernized their ERP. You saw a lot of examples of that. Then you've got security, right? Absolutely has to happen. And then lots of focus on now on data and AI, particularly for those who've already been investing, so they're in the cloud, they've got their modern ERP, and now they want to really accelerate AI. So what's not happening, right, is discretionary spend globally as we saw throughout the year, starting in North America, people are not doing smaller systems integration. They're not doing smaller strategy and consulting, they're prioritizing and focusing on larger deals. And even there, there's prioritizing, especially depending on the industry where you've got more challenges to say, can we -- we've got a lot underway, we're cautious about the environment, so help us Accenture cut costs, so we can afford all of the reinvention ahead of us and help us prioritize what we start next. And that's kind of the overall, sort of, more cautious spending. But I just want to reemphasize, nothing has changed about the fact that our clients have more ahead of them than behind them in terms of building the digital core and then using it to reinvent. And we're the only one in our industry that can both build the technology and at this scale have the industry and the functional expertise to then be positioned to help them use that technology to reinvent. So we are super optimistic about this industry in our position.\nDarrin Peller: That makes sense, Julie. And just -- I guess, as a follow-up to that, the ramp time, you know, you talked about a billion dollars investment in AI last time, and we've obviously seen some evidence of success, but early days still. So now that you've had the luxury of a few more months, the ramp time you'd expect to see that really become a much, much bigger part of the business. Can you just quickly touch on that again? This is around AI and generative AI. Thanks, [Indiscernible].\nJulie Sweet: I'm sure -- my team are going to love the luxury of a few more months. You know, so thank you for that, I'm going to tell them that. See you guys, you've had a few more months. So look, as I talked a little bit about in our script, we're still learning. Remember, these are like, you know, a million dollar sort of things. We're starting tom, you know, look at our -- work it in our own delivery. So it's going to take a few more quarters till I've really got a well-informed view of that. But what I will say is, gen AI is an amazing technology. It's going to do great things. And what I tell all my clients, can't use it unless you're in the cloud, have data, and you've, you know, modernized your core. So that's our opportunity.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And we'll go next to the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to pick up on your earlier comment, I think you said that you're not assuming any improvement in discretionary spending in the overall environment there during F ‘24. So I know you guys typically start the year with a relatively conservative approach to guidance that certainly served you quite well in fiscal ‘23. So against that backdrop, can you tell us a little bit about what you're thinking regarding growth for each of the three business dimensions in F ‘24?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. So, Jason, let me just kind of give you a little bit more color on guidance, right? So, as we mentioned, we're not assuming in our guidance any improvement in the macro discretionary spend, but we're going to pivot two years of growth. So the macro is going to be kind of this, you know, it's not going to help us or hurt us this year is kind of what really essentially what we're saying. In terms of, you know, color, I'll kind of stick to what we have in the type of work, maybe is the best way of thinking about it. And again, I think just consulting, it's going to build as we go throughout the year. And overall, I think, it's important to know that we are going to build in this environment. We're going to build as we go throughout the year.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, and then on -- just on bookings, any thoughts on the first quarter or the full-year? I know there's some seasonal elements that typically consider in the November quarter? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, sure. So let me just talk about maybe a little bit of bookings. You know, in bookings, we're going to start with the fourth quarter. I mean, if did come in a little bit lighter than we expected, and they can be lumpy, and we saw some deals, kind of, push out. Of the quarter, when it came to small deals, we didn't see any change in the discretionary spend environment. And just to reiterate that we're really pleased with the 21 clients that we had, over $100 million. Julie talked about that, if just reinforces our strategy to be the client's transformational partner of choice and to be at their core. And lastly, as it relates to ‘23, you know, we look at bookings that we're rolling for quarters and I mentioned this on managed services, but just overall we're at a 1.1 book to bill, which I'm really pleased about for the fourth quarters. And then for next year, looking at ‘24 Q1, you're right, it's seasonally a little lighter for us. However, we have a solid pipeline and we do expect that FY ’24 Q1 bookings will reflect growth over FY ’23 Q1.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you.\nKatie O'Conor: Operator, we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And that question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Mr. Keane, your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Wanted to just follow up on strategy and consulting. I know that that was an area that we were hoping at one point during the year that it was going to turn back to positive growth by the fourth quarter. And then I know we didn't think that was going to happen as of last quarter. So I'm just curious, as we go through the year into fiscal year '24, when do you think S&C might turn towards positive growth?\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. So, look, in terms of our full year range, at the top end of our full year range, which again, always where we try to be, it does reflect S&C reconnecting with growth, and that clearly is our goal. Now when -- really the pace is going to differ by market, right, so it's hard to tell exactly when it will be throughout the year. Of course, we'll update you as we go through. And North America is our biggest market, it will be a bit more challenged.\nBryan Keane: Got it. I'll leave it there because I know we're at the end of the call. Thanks so much.\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks so much. Take care.\nJulie Sweet: All right.

Welcome to Accenture's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatie O'Conor: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results; KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter; Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2024; we will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking, and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie and everyone joining, and thanks to our 743,000 people around the world for their incredible dedication and commitment every day, which is how we are able to consistently deliver 360 degree value for all our stakeholders. I am pleased that we delivered on our commitments this quarter, while continuing to invest significantly in strategic areas to drive the next waves of growth, including extending our early leadership in generative AI, and we did so against a macro backdrop that continues to be challenging. Starting with our financial results. Our bookings were $18.4 billion, representing 12% growth in local currency. We had 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in the quarter and over half were in North America, representing the trust our clients have in us to be at the center of their major programs, spending and ongoing reinvention. We delivered revenues of $16.2 billion for the quarter, at the top-end of our FX adjusted range, representing growth -- 1% growth in local currency. We continue to take market share. As expected, we continue to see lower discretionary spend, which particularly impacts our consulting type of work as well as slower decision making and our CMT industry group continues to be challenged. We remain on track with the business optimization actions we announced in March to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience. And finally, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6%, while continuing to invest in our business and our people. Turning now to our investments. We closed 12 acquisitions this quarter for a total of $788 million in strategic areas across our geographic markets. In North America, we are continuing to build out our new growth area of capital projects, an $88 billion addressable market in North America, which we entered in August with the acquisition of Anser Advisory. In Q1, we added Comtech, a consulting and program management company for infrastructure projects in Canada. We also invested in the next digital frontier with our supply chain acquisition of The Shelby Group. We expanded our cloud capabilities with the acquisitions of Ocelot Consulting and Incapsulate. And we invested in digital marketing in the healthcare industry with the acquisition of ConcentricLife. In EMEA, we expanded our cybersecurity capabilities with the acquisition of Innotec in Spain, enhanced our business process services in the insurance industry with the acquisition of ON Service GROUP in Germany, and invested in digital healthcare and talent with the acquisitions of Nautilus Consulting and The Storytellers in the UK. Finally, in Growth Markets, we are focused on the cloud opportunity with the acquisition of Solnet in New Zealand, along with cybersecurity with the acquisition of MNEMO in Mexico, and on digital marketing services with the Song acquisition of SIGNAL in Japan. Our ability to invest at scale to fuel our organic growth is a competitive advantage. For example, in EMEA, we are focusing on pivoting our CMT business. We are investing with Vodafone to create a strategic partnership to commercialize its market-leading shared services operations and unlock new sources of growth and efficiency, enhance speed to market and new customer opportunities for their operating companies and partner markets. Together, we plan to create a new data and AI-driven shared services model and a scaled, commercially-driven and more efficient organization with higher-quality services and enhanced speed to market for its portfolio of offerings. The new unit will utilize Accenture's world-class technology, transformation and managed services such as its digital solutions and platforms and deep AI expertise. It will also tap into our well-known learning capabilities to continuously create new skilling and career paths for our -- for its people. This move speaks to Vodafone's ambition to work in new ways, reduce structural complexity, reinvent their company and the industry. And of course, we continue to invest in learning for our people with approximately 8 million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 12 hours per person. Turning to generative AI, our growth and investments. We continue to take an early leadership position in GenAI, which will be an important part of the reinvention of our clients in the next decade. Last quarter, we shared that we had sold approximately 300 projects with $300 million in sales in all of FY '23. Demand continued to accelerate in Q1 with over $450 million in GenAI sales. As you know, we are investing $3 billion in AI over three years. For many of our clients, 2023 was a year of generative AI experimentation. We are now focusing on helping our clients in 2024 realize value at scale. We are excited about the recent launch of our specialized services to help companies customize and manage foundation models. We're seeing that the true value of generative AI is to deliver on personalization and business relevance. This is driven by context and accuracy, data readiness along with foundation model choices and customization are some of the most important steps and decisions that companies will make in the next year as they pursue value. Our clients are going to use an array of models to achieve their business objectives. Our proprietary switchboard allows a user to select the combination of models to address business context or factors like cost or accuracy. And we will offer rigorous training and certification programs to organizations using these new services to customize and scale GenAI solutions and transform every link in their value chain. We are also investing in AI acquisitions. For example, we recently announced our intent to acquire Ammagamma, an Italy-based firm that helps companies advance their uses of AI and generative AI technologies. With this acquisition, we will add 90 experienced AI professionals, many specializing in generative AI along with the expertise that includes engineering, mathematics, economics, historians, philosophers and designers, who will join our growing network of professionals in our advanced center for AI. And we are progressing towards our goal of doubling our deeply skilled data and AI practitioners from 40,000 to 80,000, with an additional 5,000 practitioners as of Q1. Finally, a few additional highlights of the 360 degree value that we created this quarter. We recently achieved our highest brand value and rank to date on Interbrand's prestigious Best Global Brands list, increasing to $21.3 billion and ranking number 30. We jumped from number 17 to number 10 on the 2023 World's Best Workplaces list by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This recognition is particularly noteworthy, because it is based on feedback from our people. We were recognized for the seventh year in a row on the Wall Street Journal list of Best-Managed Companies for excellence in customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility, and financial strength. And we also received the top score for social responsibility and are among the top 10 for customer satisfaction. We continue to lead in our ability to attract people with different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different lived experiences. Our success is reflected in the top score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index in the U.S. for the 16th consecutive year for leading equitable workplace policies, practices and benefits for LGBTQ+ people. And today, we are proud to present an update to our 360-degree value reporting experience, which is available on our website, because we believe that transparency builds trust and helps us all make more progress. Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our Q1 results, which were in-line with our expectations and include continued investments at scale to strengthen our position as a leader in the market. Once again, our results illustrate our ability to manage our business with rigor and discipline and deliver value for our shareholders. So, let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 1% local currency with mid-single digit growth or higher in five of our 13 industries, including public service, industrial, utilities, health and energy. As expected, we saw continued pressure in our CMT industry group. And we continue to take market share. As a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about a third of our addressable market. We use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of any significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.27, reflecting 6% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.7% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points over Q1 last year and includes significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $430 million and returned $2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $788 million in acquisitions across 12 transactions in the quarter. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $18.4 billion for the quarter, representing 14% growth in U.S. dollars and 12% growth in local currency, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $8.6 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Managed services bookings were $9.8 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.2 billion, a 3% increase in U.S. dollars and 1% local currency, and we're at the top-end of our guided range adjusted for a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately 1.5% compared to the 2.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, flat in U.S. dollars and a decline of 2% in local currency. Managed services revenues were $7.8 billion, up 6% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions: technology services grew mid-single digits, operations was flat, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue declined 1% in local currency. Growth was led by public service, offset by declines in communications and media, software and platforms, and banking and capital markets. Before I continue, I want to highlight that for this fiscal year '24, we have reorganized our geographic segments. Europe is now EMEA and includes the Middle East and Africa, which were previously included in Growth Markets. The reclassification for prior years can be found in our Investor Relations website. In EMEA, revenues grew 2% in local currency, led by growth in public service and banking and capital markets, partially offset by a decline in communications and media. Revenue growth was driven by Italy, Austria, and France, partially offset by a decline in the United Kingdom. In Growth Markets, we delivered 5% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in chemicals and natural resources, public service, and banking and capital markets. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.6% compared to 32.9% for the first quarter of last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared with 9.8% for the first quarter of last year. General and administrative expense was 6.4% compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q1, we recorded $140 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 90 basis points and EPS by $0.17. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.7% operating margin, an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in Q1 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.3% for the first quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.27 compared with diluted EPS of $3.08 in the first quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 49 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 48 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $430 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $499 million, net of property and equipment additions of $69 million. Our cash balance at November 30th was $7.1 billion compared with $9 billion at August 31st. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $1.2 billion at an average price of $311.90 per share. At November 30th, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $810 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on February 15th, a 15% increase over last year. So, in closing, we remain committed to delivering on our long-standing financial objectives, growing faster than market and taking share, generating modest margin expansion and stronger earnings, while at the same time investing at scale for our long-term market leadership, generating strong free cash flow and returning a significant portion of that cash to shareholders. And now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. As we begin our second quarter, we remain laser-focused on creating value for our clients. The pace of spending continues to be impacted by the macro environment. Our business in the UK in particular, in Q1, saw even greater challenges than we expected last quarter. The fundamentals of our industry remain unchanged. All strategies continue to lead to technology and companies need to reinvent every part of their enterprise using tech, data and AI to optimize operations and accelerate growth. To do so, they must build a digital core. Strategy and consulting, which brings our deep industry and functional expertise is critical to how we differentiate by helping our clients ensure they drive business value from their digital core. We are continuing to see significant demand in areas like cloud migration and modernization, modern ERP and data and AI, including GenAI, platforms and security, all of which represent areas of great opportunity and is still early with more digital core to be built in the future than has been done to date. Let me bring to life the significant opportunities still ahead with examples from the quarter. Our cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong double-digit growth, reflecting the ongoing significant market opportunity. We estimate only 40% of enterprise workloads are in the cloud, of which only 20% or so are modernized, an 80% opportunity remaining. Clients are continuing to prioritize the digital core as evidenced by strong demand for cloud migration. We're working with a leading insurance provider to continue their cloud transformation. Together, we are migrating hundreds of applications to a cloud-based platform, enabling the company to exit their data centers by 2025. To date, we have migrated more than half of their apps to the cloud. And this is not just a migration. We are modernizing applications and accelerating automation to integrate disparate data more easily from acquisitions and help the company move into new markets. And we are helping reshape their organizational mindset, drive cultural change and find new ways of working, including the creation of a new IT service model to lead complex transformations with agility and speed. This transformation will reduce legacy complexity and technical debt, enable more cost effective back-office operations, and drive growth and innovation, ultimately helping the company provide more affordable and personalized insurance solutions for families and businesses. And for those clients who have made significant progress on their migration, they are investing to modernize and innovate across the cloud continuum, extending cloud to the edge, unlocking greater value with more opportunities still ahead. For example, we recently announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with McDonald's to help it execute their technology strategy and leverage the company's scale to unlock greater speed and efficiency for customers, restaurant teams and employees. This new work supports McDonald's ambition to connect restaurants worldwide with cloud technology and apply generative AI solutions across McDonald's platforms. Accenture also will support the acceleration of automation innovation and the enhancement of the digital capabilities of McDonald's employees. Accenture's deep understanding of the McDonald's business, industry and technology will help unlock opportunities in their ongoing digital investments as McDonald's reinvents the customer experience and stays ahead of their customers' changing needs. Turning to data and AI. We estimate that less than 10% of companies have mature data and AI capabilities. This is a critical part of building the digital core and we see this embedded in our larger transformations, in work focused on data and AI modernization and in the opportunities of generative AI. We help leaders such as BBVA, a global financial services group, to stay ahead of the curve by continuing to reinvent its business model with GenAI. For example, we are building a GenAI-powered financial coach assistant to help them disrupt customer centricity in the banking industry while they reinvent their digital core to also become even more efficient. This work is a continuation of our ongoing GenAI implementation which is transforming BBVA's operations and digital marketing and is helping employees be more productive. Thanks to its strong digital core, BBVA can continue to reinvent across their enterprise by applying GenAI. We're also helping a global hospitality group to support its content production capability and marketing communications across its hotel brands, tailoring content to guests' evolving needs. This new data-driven content supply chain model will create personalized, flexible and efficient marketing communications content across every customer touchpoint. Spanning both physical and digital communications, this service will be available to all marketing professionals enabling content production management from its initial brief to performance measurement and content optimization. This will increase the effectiveness of its digital marketing programs, drive more traffic to its branded website, and deliver exceptional customer experiences, all while reducing costs. Platforms are a core component of the digital core and are critical to our clients' transformations. We estimate 60% of the opportunity is still ahead as clients upgrade their core platforms. We are working with OCBC Group, a Singapore-based multinational banking and financial services corporation, on a two-year transformation journey to modernize their human resources organization. We will shift key HR functions such as hiring, talent management, and career development to the cloud and create a next-generation HR operating model with enhanced capabilities. Together, we will drive operational efficiency with a strategic focus on future talent readiness, employee experience, and AI-driven decision-making. And by providing a scalable framework to meet evolving business needs, we'll free up HR capacity to provide high-value advisory work and empower business and HR leaders with analytics and insights to facilitate better talent decisions. Security is also essential to a digital core, and we continue to see very strong double-digit growth in our security business this quarter. While the opportunity to continue to grow and expand, we estimate that currently only 36% of business leaders are confident that their organizations are cyber resilient, representing at least 64% of untapped potential. An example of our important work with our clients to build secure organizations is Fortrea, a global contract research organization of about 19,000 people that provides clinical trial and research services for life sciences companies in more than 90 countries. We're working with Fortrea to deliver database outcomes and health-related insights, which require adherence to regional and local industry and government regulations. As they continue to grow and enter new markets, they need a partner to ensure that their cybersecurity program remains resilient and compliant with security best practices. We will co-create, architect, and operate a series of global cybersecurity services and capabilities through our managed services. Our partnership will help Fortrea grow its business, utilizing flexible risk and security strategies. We are focused on helping clients reimagine marketing and their customer experience to drive growth. Song demand continues to remain strong with double-digit growth in Q1. We are collaborating with Peugeot, a French automotive brand, to lead strategic and creative direction for its global communications. The partnership supports Peugeot's ambition to engage a younger audience and become a leader in the electric vehicle market. Accenture Song will manage global communications across all traditional and digital media channels. The first campaign will be a full 360 integrated launch of the all-new electric fastback SUV E-3008 in early 2024. Finally, we continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. We estimate that only 5% of enterprises have scaled, matured digital capabilities across their organizations. Industry X grew strong double digits in Q1. We are working with a leading global -- a leading German multinational car manufacturer to engineer the next generation of infotainment system. Using our deep industry expertise and software engineering capabilities, we will support the implementation of a new flexible platform that enables the next level of in-car experience with cutting-edge customer features while minimizing complexity and maximizing the software we use across hardware generations. We're working with a global food manufacturer on a total enterprise reinvention strategy to modernize its supply chain, reduce operating costs, and position it for the future. We will transform key supply chain processes such as planning, procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. AI and intelligent automation will optimize end-to-end supply chain operations and achieve greater efficiency and agility. It will also help the company leverage data for better decision making and implement portfolio optimization to ensure the right assets are focused on for investment to maximize returns and minimize risks. This self-funded program is expected to generate significant productivity gains with ongoing savings fueling further capability builds and bottom-line growth. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal '24, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.4 billion to $16 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 0.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23 and reflects an estimated negative 2% to positive 2% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '24, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal '23. For the full fiscal '24, we continue to expect our revenue to be in the range of 2% to 5% growth in local currency over fiscal '23, with the inorganic contribution now expected to be more than 2%. We continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal '24 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. The following guidance for full year '24 excludes these impacts. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '24 to be 15.5% to 15.7%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '23 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '23. We continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '24 to be in the range of $11.97 to $12.32 or 3% to 6% growth over adjusted fiscal '23 results. For the full fiscal '24, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Happy holidays. I just wanted to start with a question on the revenue guidance for Q2. The midpoint there would suggest 1 point of deceleration, but we do have an easier comparison, and there was a return to positive growth in consulting bookings. So, just hoping you can help us reconcile that and then maybe comment on the second half reacceleration that is continuing to be implied in the guide, maybe slightly steeper than previously thought. Thank you.\nKC McClure: Yeah, great. Thanks, Jason. Happy holidays to you, too. So first, let me first start in terms of our guidance. I'll first start with Q1. And as you heard us say, we were really pleased with our Q1 performance. And as you stated, our Q2 guidance is the same as Q1. And maybe a couple of things that I'll point out compared to what we thought 90 days ago, and as Julie mentioned, we do see some differences in EMEA, particularly in the UK, where we're focused on repositioning the business back to growth, and that's going to take some time. But Jason, what is the same is that we are still operating in an environment, which is the same that we described last quarter, where the discretionary spend and the decision making is slow. And so right now, as you expect, and you know that we do this every year, we're talking to our clients right now about their '24 budgets. And so that's all, again, to be expected. When we look forward into H2, to start with just what the math is, we continue to see higher growth in the back half of the year. That's going to start with higher growth in Q3. And our confidence in our H2 increased growth is really based on a few things. Again, reiterating what we talked about at the beginning of the year versus our results in Q1, so we're confident, again, that we were able to deliver across the board as we expected in the first quarter. And also then, as Julie mentioned quite a bit, we made a lot of investments in our business in the quarter, and that's helping us pivot to higher growth areas. In addition to that, as we talked about last quarter, the same remains, we do have our revenue positioned in the back half of our year from these larger transformation deals. So that has not changed. We continue to see that. And then, we just need to continue to layer in our new sales as we get closer to the back half of the year. So, we're really very pleased to reiterate the 2% to 5% revenue guidance that we had at the beginning of the year.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, what should we expect in terms of second quarter bookings for consulting and management -- managed services year-over-year? I know managed services has a particularly tough comp. Thanks again.\nKC McClure: Yeah. So, Jason, I know I've been giving color and basically kind of guiding to future quarter bookings, but as you know really well covering up for so long, bookings can really be lumpy. So, I'm not going to give that color anymore, go forward. What I would say is the best way to think about demand for our business is the revenue guide that we give. And we gave revenue guidance for the second quarter as well as our 2% to 5% for the full year. And obviously, we'll continue to do that. And I'll just put in that we do feel good about our pipeline. We have a very solid pipeline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, perfect. Yeah, I just want to follow up to Jason's question just with the bookings, which is better than expected, and your large deal backlog is quite large now. Just the visibility on the timeliness of those conversions? Have you seen any signs of pushout or delays or that kind of thing? Just trying to understand the conversion potential.\nKC McClure: Yeah. So maybe just a couple of things on that. So I think, conversion can be really mainly impacted by the mix, right? So, the mix of deals that we have. So, let's just start with, overall, we haven't seen any change in the conversion based on the mix of work. So, strategy and consulting which converts faster than with operations. There's been no change within those different parts of our business, no change in the conversion. What we have talked about, and we've been consistent, that there's really been -- there's no change over the last 90 days in our discretionary spend environment, and that is consistent with our expectations. So -- and we haven't been reliant, and we're not reliant on a change in that macro to get to our full-year guidance. So, what does that mean? Hopefully you guys can hear me. The lower -- a little trouble in the line. Okay. Is that there -- as we have lower discretionary spend, that does impact the conversion, Tien-Tsin, as you know, but we have factored that all into our guidance.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Understood, KC. Thanks for that. And just my quick follow-up. I know you've been really busy with acquisitions, and Julie, you listed a bunch of them. Is there a change here in the rhythm of acquisitions or your appetite? It sounds like the revenue contribution is up a nudge, but -- up a little bit. But you tell me. I didn't know if there was a change in your thinking here on the deal. Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yeah. I'm going to maybe give a little bit of color and then I'll certainly hand it over to Julie. Just more from a financial perspective, I think -- and as you know this really well, but our competitive advantage really is our investment capacity that allows us to pivot to higher areas of growth. And we can do that and invest through every cycle, and you've seen us do that. And I really think that is clearly a differentiator for us. You see that with our strong start this quarter. Julie talked about the 12 acquisitions, $800 million of spend, and we have five more that we've announced for Q2. All of that, and we're reconfirming op margin expansion of 10 basis points to 30 basis points. I think it's important to see that in terms of our strategy, we're continuing to do this to really fuel organic growth. And lastly, I think one of the parts that really distinguishes us is our capital allocation framework, which is durable yet flexible. So, we're able to flex up and do inorganic to the degree that we see that we'd like to, while at the same time, continuing to increase our return to our shareholders. So, I think it's really, really great.\nJulie Sweet: Great. Yeah. And there's no change in the strategies in the sense of we're still trying to -- we're still investing to either scale in hot areas or add new types of skills. So, you see that we're executing in capital projects like we described, right? In August, we did the -- yeah, in August, we did the Anser Advisory. We just added Canada. And then, of course, adding the niche skills in consulting and whether it's industry or functional. So, no change in strategy. But I would reiterate that it is really a huge competitive advantage for us that we can invest across the cycles. You saw that we did that in the first year after the pandemic, where we significantly increased, and again, always to drive organic growth and position ourselves for those next waves. So, you're going to see the AI acquisitions. You saw health in the UK, another great area of growth, capital projects. So, think about our strengths here is how we accelerate pivoting to growth.\nKC McClure: And then, I'll just add, Tien-Tsin, that you heard me mention in guidance, that we are going to do now more than 2% in organic contribution for this year.\nJulie Sweet: Yeah.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yeah. No, I'm sure you'll amplify the growth of what you buy. Just wanted to check on that. That's helpful. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thanks, and congratulations on the performance. Happy holidays from me. I wanted to ask about, as you have conversations with your clients with regards to budget and spending priorities into next year, if you can comment, first of all, on that? And then, it's only a couple of quarters since sort of the GenAI kind of took hold, but it's a fast-moving technology, and I want to kind of inquire into whether the nature of those discussions has changed or become more meaningful, gone past proofs of concept and so on.\nJulie Sweet: Great. And happy holidays to you, too. Great question. So first, with respect to -- on your first point around what's happening in the market on client budgets is what I would say is that we're having lots of discussions that are pretty similar to what we've been talking about, which is, how do you prioritize in a more cautionary environment? So, we'll really know how that will play out in January as always because this is when we -- they finalize. But what I'd say is it's a consistent thing I've been talking about, which is in a cautionary environment, in a tough macro, we're helping clients prioritize. And they're in the things that we talked about in the script again today, things like building the digital core. It's using the technology to drive both growth and cost. And I would just say on the macro side, right, is that, our clients, we recognize you cannot cut yourself to growth. And if you think about the examples that I used in today's script, most of them were both cost and growth, right? Because that is what our clients are focused on, is how are they going to grow revenue despite whatever the environment is. And that, of course, is our unique capabilities to be able to do both. And then, with respect to GenAI, so first of all, I just want to say $450 million in sales this quarter, we're very pleased with. I mean, it demonstrates we are leading here. All of last year, it was $300 million. And to your point, the conversations are changing. You have examples like BBVA, which we talked about earlier in my script, where we're starting to use it at scale. Our clients want to get out of proofs of concept to material value, and we're super well positioned. Why? GenAI is not plug and play. It is not just technology. In fact, it's closer to any other technology. Think about cloud, that's farther away from the heart of the business. In order to scale, you have to deeply understand the technology, which is still rapidly changing, and the business value. And this is Accenture's leadership position, right? We have strategy. We have consulting, deep industry and functional expertise. We're the biggest partner with every major player. We're working with them at a product level and we can bring those two things together. So, think of 2024 as being the shift for our clients from experimentation to scale, and we believe we're at the best position to lead that shift to value.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Understood. I want to ask also about operations performance. It did decelerate meaningfully. I think it was high-single-digit growth, and now it's flat. Is that also a reflection you mentioned just now, maybe a pivot from cost savings to revenue generation maybe is beginning? Is that what's happening or are there other factors in here?\nKC McClure: Yeah. Maybe just in terms of the quarter performance, operations came in as expected. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, Ashwin, we do have some impacts in CMT that impact operations, and so we'll see that growth may fluctuate as we go throughout the year. As part, though, of our overall guidance for the full year of managed services continuing to be mid-single to high-single-digit growth for the year.\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. And in fact, I would say, it's the opposite. Operations, which was impacted, by the way, by CMT, for example, look, it's going to build similar to the way Accenture is going to build over the course of the year. Actually, the sweet spot of operations is that it does both cost and growth. So, the BBVA example includes operations, Fortrea includes operations. So, these are -- our managed services are highly strategic because they are typically able to do both. Think about IT transformation. Our managed services are as much about modernizing. So, in IT, modernized tech is what drives growth. So, we really see our strength being that our managed services are strategic. And one of the reasons is that we do them in the context of understanding the industry and the function. So, we're not back office. We're bringing that strategy and consulting expertise to make sure that it isn't just a cost play. And that's an important differentiator for us.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you both.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. I wanted to start on your some of the expectations around shorter cycle and discretionary work within S&C and SI. Do you have a sense of stabilization forming there or cuts still occurring in those areas? And maybe can you give us a sense on how you expect consulting to do in the second quarter?\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. So, look, we're -- as KC said earlier, we're operating kind of the same environment we have for the last few quarters, right? Discretionary spend is down. And we're right in the middle of the budget cycle, so next quarter, we'll have a much better view of what's there. But if you sort of look around in the environment, there aren't a lot of green shoots on the economic side. And obviously, the volatility on the geopolitical side continues. And so, as KC said, we're not planning right now for kind of a change in the macro, which means that we're not planning for a change in discretionary spending. We just don't see that being meaningfully different as we go into 2024. And obviously, we'll update you. But that's why when you think about the question earlier on revenue conversion, our level of smaller deals is just down. It's going to stay down for a while, which means that how revenues going to -- how sales are going to bleed into revenue is going to be consistent with what we've been seeing. So -- and then, you want to comment?\nKC McClure: Yeah. Just in terms of, Bryan, on the overall growth, there's no change from what we said at the beginning of the year in terms of our full-year outlook for consulting type of work. We see low-single-digit positive growth for the full year. That's in our 2% to 5%. And Q1 came in as we expected, which was negative 2%.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a clarification around the M&A. So first, I don't know if you mentioned M&A in the first quarter, the contribution to growth, and we're saying greater than 2% for the full year. Just to be clear, that's just rounding around 2% or upwards of 3%? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yeah. So, we're saying more than 2% for the full year, and it can fluctuate by quarter, so we really just stick to our guidance for the overall year.\nJulie Sweet: Right. And if we get close to 3%, we'll talk about that. But right now it's more than 2%.\nKC McClure: More than 2%.\nJulie Sweet: Right. Because we gave you guidance, so it's down definitely more than 2%. And remember, we only do deals that we think are good deals. So, what we see right now is a lot of good deals that is going to get us to above 2%. And if that -- we have a lot of financial flexibility, so if that changes, we'll update if it gets above 3%.\nBryan Bergin: Thanks. Happy holidays.\nJulie Sweet: Happy holidays.\nKC McClure: Same to you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much. One thing I noticed, I guess, gross margin growth, year-over-year expansion in gross margin was the strongest in about nine quarters or so. Is that just lower attrition, offshore shift? Maybe walk through why that's gotten nicely better.\nKC McClure: Yeah. Hey, Dave. Thanks for the question. So, as you know, we run our business to operating margin, which we did 20 basis point expansion this quarter. And I will mention that if I didn't already, that the 10 basis point to 30 basis point that we have for the year, we might see more variability as we go throughout the quarters. But now back to gross margin, you're right, we did see expansion this quarter, but it's really hard to look at that in isolation. And why is that? Well, there's various things that can go in and out of gross margin in terms of increased or decreased spend. So, for example, one would be acquisitions. There's a lot of -- some of the investment acquisitions, some of that spend will go into gross margin, and that can be lumpy as we go throughout. As you know, it also depends on where people spend their time. So for example, you saw that, yes, we had improvement in gross margin, but then we also had increased sales and marketing costs, which is a result of people spending more time out in the market selling to create the $18.4 billion in sales that we have. So that's why -- again, we look at those components, but really at the end of the day, we always continue to run our business to op margin.\nDave Koning: Got you. Thanks for that. And then, maybe as a follow-up just to Jason's question at the beginning on kind of the back-end loaded growth. If I just put in normal sequential patterns in Q3 and Q4, I get to about 2% constant currency, so the low-end of guide. Is there a scenario given bookings were really good this quarter that it actually, the progression sequentially in the back half of the year is better than normal and then that kind of gets to the better parts of the guidance range for revenue?\nKC McClure: Yeah. So, I think, obviously when you do -- what you're just kind of talking about is a bit of the math. What I would tell is give you the year-over-year way we look at it in terms of our guidance, right? So, we had 1% growth this quarter with strong bookings, right, 1% revenue growth with strong bookings. We see Q2 shaping up the same way year-over-year. And again, just reinforcing that we do see fuel in our sequential growth in the back half of the year based on the transformation deals that we have signed. That's no different than what we talked about at the beginning of the year. We've layered in then the sales that we expect as we go throughout. And that -- there's no difference to how we're doing our range that gets us to the 2% to 5% range. I would say at the top end of our range, again, as we said, last quarter, just when we said guidance, that when -- to get to the top end of our guidance range, you would see S&C reconnecting with growth would be one thing that we'd see. And you would probably also see the mid- to high-single digits that we've been referencing consistently in managed services be more like high-single digits. So hopefully that helps, Dave.\nDave Koning: Yeah, that's helpful. Thanks, guys. Nice job.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask on the clarification on the UK market in particular. I know the economy has been weak there for a couple years. So -- and I know it's been a call out for kind of the quarter. What exactly happened in the UK? And then, what's the outlook for that?\nJulie Sweet: In the UK, as you said it, it has been kind of challenge for a couple of years, and we have a big banking capital markets business there, and we're really trying to pivot to more growth there in other areas. That's why you saw the acquisitions that we did, for example, this quarter. And what we're seeing is that it's just taking longer than we anticipated to really move into the other areas. And banking capital markets, which we've talked about, has been more challenged, particularly in the UK. And so, it's really about how long it's taking us to pivot. And we think it's going to take some time. So, I'm not going to call exactly when, but we do think it's going to take some time, and it's taking more time than we anticipated going into the fiscal year. So, we've got a good team. We're on it. And again, this is where you're going to see us do more acquisitions to diversify our business there as we reposition that.\nKC McClure: Yeah. Maybe just also, Bryan, just for context, it's about 6% of our overall business, a little bit more than $4 billion that we have in the UK.\nBryan Keane: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then, KC, just to make sure we understand, the comments on the margins, given the movement in acquisition and the pick of an acquisition, there could be some fluctuations in given quarters. You're not going to have it perfectly 10 -- in the range of 10 basis points to 30 basis points per quarter. Any quarters to call in particular where it could fall below the range given the ramp of acquisitions and the ramp of investments? Thanks.\nKC McClure: Yeah. I don't want to really guide to the quarter because 10 basis points or 20 basis points on a quarter, that's spend, Bryan, as you know. That's kind of big and small in terms of the dollar amount that we're talking about. So, we're going to guide overall to the full year of 10 basis points to 30 basis points for the full year. And I just wanted to point out that we might have some periods where it's just a little bit more variable than what you've seen us do over the years.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thank you. Happy holidays.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Hey, thanks guys. Just want to touch on headcount growth. I mean, it's still -- I think it's still a bit decelerating. And so, what are the expectations going forward, I mean, just given the backdrop of an acceleration on the revenue in the second half of the year? And then, Julie, maybe we could just touch on the linearity of the business one more time. Just if we could revisit the mix of the kind of business you're seeing now and the revenue per head you'd expect, or maybe just directionally, what you'd anticipate based on the mix we're seeing and what demand is for?\nKC McClure: Yeah. So, thanks for that, Darrin. So, I'll talk about -- in terms of our people, in terms of number of people we have, first, I'll start with, as you know, managing supply-demand is really our core competency. And you can see that in our ability to manage our utilization at high levels. And I'll just point out that for the last 13 quarters, our utilization has been 91% or higher. And so, we hire for the skills that we need and we hire where we need them. And what you're pointing out is that we had about a 1% increase year-over-year in our headcount, as well as about a 1% sequentially. And that's in-line with what we -- how we see revenue going for the rest of the year. So there's really no change there. And as it relates to the revenue per head and the non-linearity, I mean, we do have automation. We do have value-based projects. So, while there still is a, obviously, connection to the amount of people that we have, we have been able to break that. There are parts where we are able to not fully disconnect, but not completely rely on headcount to drive revenue.\nJulie Sweet: And Darrin, in terms of just demand, right, so I'd kind of anchor to, first of all, we're seeing demand for transformational deals. So, in an environment like this, the thing that I look at most is, are we continuing to have our clients do more than $100 million of bookings, right, which is in our industry, we are a real standout here. And what does that mean? That means that we continue to be at the heart of where clients are spending to do material transformations. That's where you want to be so that you're positioned when inevitably discretionary spending, the pace goes back up, the macro changes, you want to be at the heart. So, at times like this, that's what I'm really looking at. And that's where you're seeing -- I will tell you, this is one of the most exciting times in the market. Like you just take what we are announcing today on McDonald's. I talked about in the script, right? Incredible company, technology driven. We've been their long-time partner. Just expanded the partnership to take it all the way to the edge and reinvent their restaurants and their crew experience. This is going to be really cutting work at the edge, because that's where we're starting to see the leaders in cloud go, and we're leading there. Those are the kinds of things that then you see how they're going to expand. There's so much opportunity still in these big areas of cloud, of data, and AI. But cloud itself, yes, we've done a lot of migration. There's still more migration to go, but even more importantly, you've got to take it all the way to the edge. So, from a demand perspective, we continue to see the transformations that move the needle for cost and growth, and that's what we're expecting. From a mix perspective, we're not seeing a big change between managed services and consulting. The mix we're seeing is that in this environment, you're seeing less of the smaller deals, which convert to revenue faster, and more on the larger deals. And that's been around for a while, and that's what you're going to continue to see. And we are laser-focused on making sure we are winning in the reinvention, the transformation, and at the same time massively pivoting to GenAI, right? And our clients have so much work to do to be able to use GenAI, but you can see the momentum in our business, right, from that change from $300 million of all of last year to $450 million in a quarter. And I'll just remind you, that's not the pull-through. That's not data. We are very pure because we really want to be sharing with all of you where is GenAI in the market. So, we're pretty excited about where we are today and what's ahead.\nDarrin Peller: That's really helpful. Look, you guys have obviously managed well through what was a softer discretionary demand environment. So, I guess, my question would be, if we thought about what a normalized run rate of revenues on really S&C would be, if we just said today's a normal, no longer softer discretionary environment, where do you think the difference is? I mean, I know it's probably hard to give an exact or precise estimate, but how much upside is there when we get that back?\nJulie Sweet: Well, we have a good -- a really strong strategy in consulting business. And so, we're very positive about that business growing. But beyond that, I think, Darrin, we're not going to start to predict growth rates. But in the meantime, it is a huge differentiator. Nobody has that combination that we have, and that is what is driving the resilience of our business to be at the core of our clients' agenda. Thanks so much, Darrin.\nDarrin Peller: Great. Thanks, guys.\nKatie O'Conor: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great, thank you so much. I want to just ask a couple of follow-up questions to those that have already been asked. First on the inorganic contribution, appreciate that it's going to be better than 2%. Can you talk a little bit about whether that increased activity is -- or how you would balance that increased activity between just better valuations and more opportunities from a purely financial perspective in the market versus it sounds like some of the acquisitions you're doing, you're just trying to push into new strategic areas, and just wondering how you're balancing those strategic imperatives versus perhaps a little better valuations?\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't call out -- I wouldn't say that this activity is because of better valuations, right? At any given time when we look at the market, right, and we see where are the growth opportunities, we want to move quickly and we look at organic versus inorganic ways of moving quickly. We never do anything purely inorganic, right, or purely organic. And so, think about our acquisitions as being matched to what is the opportunity in the market and what's the best way to capture that growth quickly, right? And so, the strategy of categories is the same, right? So, there are new areas that we want to go into, like capital markets. That's an investment decision. We go into a certain number of those. We're executing now with rigor. We went and bought Anser Advisory. Now we bought the next one in Canada, right? So that's just about -- it's a great growth area and we're trying to pivot. And the best way to do that to build something that we don't have already organically is to make some inorganic acquisitions and then that becomes organic growth and we're able to kick in our recruiting machine. If you think about the UK, health is a great area. We just bought a health company, right? So, you look at the market and you say, \"If I want to diversify, what's the fastest way to diversify into new areas?\" And that's where often inorganic can help us do that through these niche acquisitions and consulting and industry. And then, you've got just massive opportunities like cloud and security, where you saw some of those acquisitions in supply chain. And that's all about both adding phenomenal talent quickly and scaling to go after a market that's today, right? So, that's how we think about it. It's extremely rigorous. We always have a decision what's the best way to get there organically or inorganically. And inorganic is always about acceleration and driving organic growth. So, it's very consistent. We've been doing it in a very disciplined way. And in these kinds of environments, we believe the companies that invest win. And that is why we do actions like we did last year to increase our business resilience and enable us to be really well positioned to invest when others are not.\nJames Faucette: That's great color. I appreciate that. And similarly, just on bookings activity and AI contribution, there are clear acceleration in the AI level of activity, et cetera. When you're talking to clients and that kind of thing, how are they thinking about AI budget allocation versus other initiatives, et cetera, right now? Are they looking at it as, \"Hey, this is an incremental investment that we need to be making given the pace of change in technology,\" or are they trying to really use that spend or have that spend be to offset some other projects maybe that they're going to curtail a little bit sooner? Just trying to think about as that continues to build, how we should think about it being incremental versus substitutive within a lot of the budgets.\nJulie Sweet: Right now we're seeing a lot of reprioritization, right, because -- I mean, obviously the market is growing. Like, we're growing. The market is growing. So, spending in technology is increasing. It's not increasing as fast as it was increasing a couple of years ago, right? So, spending on technology is increasing. But within that, you're seeing more prioritization. And our research, everybody's research is saying, hey, more spending on AI. For lots of companies, it's also more spending mostly on building that digital core, because many companies don't have the data estates in order -- they're not in the cloud. They don't have the data in order to use the GenAI. So, think of it as a real focus on building a digital core to enable as well. So, market is still growing. It's more about prioritization of where that spending is going. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. So, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support in all of our people for what you do every single day. And I wish everyone a happy and a healthy holiday season. Thank you for joining today.\nOperator: That does conclude your conference for today.

Thank you for standing by, welcome to Accenture's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Katie O'Conor. Please go ahead.\nKatie O'Conor: Thank you, operator. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short-time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC, will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024, we will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie and everyone joining, and thank you to our 742,000 people around the world who work every day to deliver 360 degree value for all our stakeholders. I'm pleased with our performance in an uncertain macro. Our results highlight the benefit of the deep trust our clients have in us, our capabilities to do the most complex work at the heart of their businesses, the privileged position we hold within the ecosystem and our ability to invest for the next waves of growth. We continue to see momentum in the quarter and how we are executing on our strategy to be the trusted reinvention partner of our clients, with a record 39 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. These large transformational wins position us to capture more growth as spending increases. We also had over $600 million in new GenAI bookings taking us to $1.1 billion in GenAI sales in the first-half of the fiscal year, expanding our early lead in GenAI, which is core to our clients reinvention. We now have over 53,000 skilled data and AI practitioners against our goal of doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 by the end of fiscal year 2026. We are laser-focused on the needs of our clients and this focus is reflected in our bookings of $21.6 billion, representing our second highest quarter on record. This included $10 billion of bookings in North America, our highest ever. We continue to take market-share with revenues of $15.8 billion for the quarter, flat compared to last year and slightly above the midpoint of our range. As we turn the page on the calendar year, we saw another turn of the dial unconstraining spending by our clients, including spending on our services, particularly in parts of EMEA and North America. This was evident in the composition of our new bookings, which came in differently than expected. We see clients continuing to prioritize investing in large-scale transformations which convert to revenue more slowly, while further limiting discretionary spending particularly in smaller projects. We also saw continued delays in decision-making and a slower pace of spending. We are pleased that despite these conditions our focused efforts to return to growth resulted in North America and CMT, showing improvement over last quarter. We are running our business with rigor and discipline and we remain on-track with the business optimization actions we announced last year to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 3%, we continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas with $2.1 billion of capital deployed across our geographic markets in Q2 in 11 acquisitions, bringing the total investment in acquisitions to $2.9 billion in H1 across a total of 23 acquisitions. We also continue to invest in learning for our people with approximately $10 million -- 10 million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 14 hours per person. In recognition of the 360 degree value we create, we are proud that we earned the number one position in our industry for the 11th year in a row and number 33 overall in Fortune’s list of the World's Most Admired Companies. We ranked number one in our industry and number three overall on the JUST Capital CNBC list of America's Most Just Companies. And we have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for the 17th year in a row. An important part of our growth strategy is to use our strong balance sheet to invest in order to scale higher-growth areas and expand into new growth areas. We have a strong track-record of delivering on this strategy. Here are some highlights from the quarter. In North America, we invested in supply-chain, an area with significant reinvention ahead with the additions of inside sourcing in [indiscernible] and on-process technology. We acquired Navisite site to help clients across multiple cloud providers enterprise applications and digital technologies, modernize their digital core, and in Song, we acquired Work & Co to help our clients drive growth by designing and bringing digital brand strategies to market and operationalizing world-class digital products at scale. In EMEA, we are investing to help clients build their digital core and drive growth. In the UK, we invested in 6point6, which will help our clients transform their digital capabilities and modernize their legacy systems. We also acquired in the UK, Redkite with its full stack data expertise that will help our clients accelerate their performance with data driven intelligence and AI. And in Germany we added Vocatus, which will accelerate our clients' growth strategies using behavioral economics modeling to develop pricing strategy and sales concepts for B2B and B2C models. Similarly, in good markets our acquisitions position us to drive our clients' growth agendas by expanding our capabilities in marketing and customer experience with Rabbit's Tale in Thailand and [GIC] (ph) in Singapore, helping clients in Indonesia, capitalize on their fast-growing digital economy. Our ability to invest to fuel our organic growth is a competitive advantage and as our clients continue to transform, we announced earlier this month that we will invest $1 billion over the next three years in Accenture LearnVantage, which will provide comprehensive technology learning and training services to help our clients re-skill and upskill their people. Our investment includes the acquisition of Udacity, a digital education pioneer, which we expect to close by the summer. Once closed, we will have revenue in the zone of $100 million annually. These services are highly strategic and they enhance our position as a reinvention parts are of choice, because talent is at the top of the agenda for CEOs. For example, we are helping Merck, a global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada launching groundbreaking Generative AI training program for their employees to create world class digital leaders. As a renowned thought leader in the biopharmaceutical market, Merck has long-lead the way in investing in its people and helping them build the skills and expertise needed to develop breakthrough therapies. Digital, data, analytics and AI play a pivotal role in discovering, developing, manufacturing, and providing access for patients to medicines and vaccines.

Over to you KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. And thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were pleased with our overall results in the second quarter with our second highest quarter of new bookings. We continue to invest at scale to strengthen our leadership position, while delivering value for our shareholders. Now let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter. Revenues were flat in local currency, with mid-single digit growth or higher in six of our 13 industries, including public service, life science, utilities, energy, health and high-tech. While our CMT industry group improved this quarter, we continue to see pressure as expected. And we continue to take market share. As a reminder, we assessed market growth against our investable basket which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about a third of our addressable market and we use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs. Adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions. Through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four quarter basis. Adjusted operating margin of 13.7% decreased 10 basis points, compared to Q2 last year and year-to-date operating margin is flat. This includes continued significant investments in our people and in our business. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.77, reflecting 3% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2 billion and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. In the first half of the year, we've invested $2.9 billion in acquisitions across 23 transactions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $21.6 billion for the quarter, representing a 2% decline in both US dollar and local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.4. Consulting bookings were $10.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Managed services bookings were $11.1 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Turning now to revenues, revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, flat in both US dollars and in local currency, and we're slightly above the midpoint of our guided range. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a decline of 3% in both US dollars and local-currency. Managed service revenues were $7.8 billion, up 3% in both US dollars and local-currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services grew low-single digits and operations and strategy and consulting declined low-single digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North-America revenue was flat in local currency with growth in public service, offset by declines in banking, capital markets, software and platforms and communications and media. In EMEA, revenues declined 2% in local currency with growth in public service, offset by declines in communications and media and banking capital markets. Revenue growth in Italy was offset by declines in the United Kingdom, France and Ireland. In growth markets, revenue grew 6% in local currency, led by growth in banking, capital markets, industrial, public service and chemicals and natural resources. Revenue growth was driven by Japan and Argentina, partially offset by declines in Australia and Brazil. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 30.9% compared with 30.6% for the same-period last year. So marketing expense for the quarter was 10.3% compared to 9.9% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.9% compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q2 of FY 2024 and FY 2023, we recorded $150 million and $244 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions respectively. These costs decreased operating margin by 70 basis-points and EPS by $0.14 this quarter and operating margin by 150 basis-points and EPS by $0.30 in Q2 of last year. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%, a decrease of 10 basis-points from adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.4% for the second quarter last year. Adjusted diluting earnings per share were $2.77 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.69 in the second quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 43 days compared to 49 days last quarter and 42 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $110 million. Our cash balance at February 29th was $5.1 billion compared with $9 billion at August 31st. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $1.3 billion at an average price of $352.35 per share. As of February 29th, we had approximately $4.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $813 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on May 15th, a 15% increase over last year. In closing, we remain laser focused on capturing growth opportunities in the market and delivering value for our clients. As you know and expect of us, we will operate with rigor and discipline, while continuing to invest for long-term market leadership. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. Let me give a little more color on the demand environment, all strategies continue to lead to technology and reinvention. Our clients are navigating an uncertain macro-environment due to economic, geopolitical and industry-specific conditions. And in response, we are seeing them thoughtfully prioritize larger transformations, building out their digital core to partnering, to improve productivity, to free-up more investment capacity to focus on growth and other initiatives with near-term ROI. Our focus on being at the center of our client's business doing their most complex transformational work provides us with resilience see overtime, as demonstrated by the fact that our top 100 clients have been clients for over 10 years. There is now near universal recognition of the importance of AI, which is the heart of reinvention. The ability to use AI at scale, however, varies widely with clients on a continuum with those which have strong digital cores generally seeking to move more quickly, while most clients are coming to grips with the investments needed to truly implement AI across the enterprise and nearly all are finding it difficult to scale, because the AI technology is a small part of what is needed. To reinvent using technology, data and AI you must have the right digital core, change your processes and ways of working, reskill and upskill your people and build new capabilities around responsible AI. All with a deep understanding of industry and function in order to unlock the value. And many clients need to first find more efficiency to enable scaled investment in all these capabilities, particularly in their data foundations. We are able to help our clients with this AI rotation because of our broad services across strategy and consulting, technology and operations as well as everything customer through Song and digital manufacturing and engineering through Industry X. And our relevance across the functions of the enterprises in 13 industries. Our privileged position in the technology ecosystem has perhaps never been more important. Generative AI is rapidly evolving and still in the early stages of maturity and adoption. And we are working closely with our ecosystem partners to help our clients understand the right data and AI backbone that is needed and how to achieve tangible business value. I will now bring to life the complex work we are doing at the heart of our clients' businesses. Building on the back of a long trusted partnership, we are working with Mondelez International, a world-leader in snacking with well-known brands like Oreo, belVita and Cadbury. To continue to drive growth and be an industry-leader. Having laid the foundations of a strong shared services modeled model powered by leading technology platforms and data and AI foundation we are now working on an ambitious reinvention of their digital core. We will design and implement a single cloud-based platform. We'll also modernizing the finance function and transforming their supply-chain planning and warehouse management capabilities. This will enable faster availability of products for customers to have more sales growth and maximum profitability. This new digital core will also allow Mondelez to further reinvent how they satisfy customers through the adoption of new technologies like Generative AI. Cloud continues to be the foundation of the digital core. Our cloud business grew high-single digit this quarter as clients do work across the cloud continuum from migration to modernization, to new business models to working at the intelligent edge. For example, we're helping Riyadh Air, a digitally native airline based in Saudi Arabia, become the world's first fully cloud-based airline. We will equip the brand-new airline with a cloud-only infrastructure enhanced cyber security and AI driven operations. Our capabilities will ensure that Riyadh Air’s digital core is future-proof and remains legacy free, enabling the airline to use cutting-edge technologies such as cloud, data and AI to scale quickly and deliver a seamless and more personalized travel experience for its customers and employees. This will also help the company to scale as it plans to operate over 100 destinations by 2030. We are partnering with Belden, a global networking solution organization on a cloud transformation program that will help them become a platform business. Unlocking the power of edge, data and AI to drive new business opportunities and enhance the customer experience. This platform will be powered by edge to cloud technology, allowing them to collect and analyze real-time data from industrial environments and improve operational efficiencies. This will provide valuable data driven insights to Belden and to their clients in industries where real-time insights are crucial. This reinvention will enable them to break-down operational technology silos, allowing them to become a key player in the digital twin domain. We will also help enable this new service in the market, this strategic partnership will support Belden's reinvention from a product company into a data engineering and insights company that leverages the power of platforms. We are focused on helping our clients, leverage the power of AI quickly, generating tangible business value, leveraging our investment in differentiated tools that accelerate results. Our AI Navigator has helped clients across industries outline their value case, AI architecture and AI solutions and our recently-announced AI switchboard is already helping clients with the complex new need for integration across LLM models. For example, one of the largest [indiscernible] companies is currently testing the switchboard to compare how the same prompt would be interpreted by different models and how they perform before deciding on which model to use. Ultimately an enterprise-wide AI rotation requires a strong data foundation, we are working with Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications and technology company on a radical simplification and modernization of its data ecosystem, accelerating its efforts to become AI powered. We are modernizing and consulting over 50 disparate enterprise data sources into a small integrated set forming Telstra's governed and secure data and AI core, allowing Telstra to rapidly scale bespoke Generative AI capabilities in the future. Our work will also support the company's efforts to develop responsible ethic and secure market leading AI frameworks, while helping their teams provide quicker, more effective and more personalized customer interactions. One of the areas of riches opportunities for our clients is customer experience transformation, including with Generative AI, which uses the unique capabilities of Song across creative customer insights and deep technology expertise. Song grew low-single digits this quarter, we continue to help clients reimagine marketing to drive growth. We're helping ExxonMobil, an energy super major transform and optimize its end-to-end fuels marketing operations to drive future growth. With our global capabilities, our managed services will leverage our SynOps platform to drive automation and deliver measurable efficiencies across the fuels marketing business. We are strengthening our partnership with Best Buy, a leading consumer electronics retailer across multiple fronts to reimagine the customer experience, optimize costs and drive growth. By leveraging data and Generative AI, we are helping to transform their contact center operations and improve customer and employee experience. We are also pleased to have entered into an agreement with Best Buy for lifecycle management of our own Accenture devices in North America and our creating a joint offering end-to-end field service advice support for clients. We have already applied this new offering to a major TV provider, marking our first entry into this new market. These strategic initiatives underscore our commitment to helping Best Buy, achieve superior customer experiences, operational efficiencies and growth. Security is essential to reinvention, moving beyond IT to protecting the core assets of the business and evolving the critical role of security as technologies change. We saw very strong double-digit growth in our security business this quarter. We are working with one of the largest electric utility holding companies in the United States to integrate their operational technology into a seamless unified cyber security solution. Together, we will enhance our security capabilities by implementing advanced monitoring and response, vulnerability management and security automation. This will help reduce the risk of secure of cyber events in their grid environment protecting critical infrastructure serving tens of millions of people. We continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. Industry X grew double-digits in Q2. We're working with Indo Count Industries Limited, a global leader in the home textile space on digital transformation to simplify operations, support its ambitious growth plans and maximize e-commerce opportunities. We will build a cloud-enabled digital core, powered by data and analytics that will help standardize, digitize and automate processes and operations. From supply chain to logistics to manufacturing, the new platform will enable more efficient inventory management, quality standardization optimal energy consumption and better customer experiences. Together we will reinvent their operations and help expand our business in India, Middle-East and North America, the UK and Europe. And we continue our support for corporate green transformation by promoting carbon footprint compliance to the calculation and visualization of greenhouse gas emissions. To create a market where consumers can choose environmentally conscious products and services [indiscernible] visualize the carbon footprint of each product is necessary. For example we're assisting, Matsumoto Precision, a precision machine parts processing company based in Japan to gain more detailed insight into the sustainability of their projection and achieve their decarbonization goal. We implemented a solution through our manufacturing platform that uses individual manufacturing performance information to record and report the CO2 emission on a per product basis. This will allow Matsumoto Precision to enhance understanding of the environmental impact of their business and contribute more effectively to the realization of a decarbonized society. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.25 billion to $16.85 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 1% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated negative 1% to 3% positive growth in local-currency. For the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal 2024, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3% growth in local-currency over fiscal 2023, which assumes an inorganic contribution approaching 3%. We continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis-points and EPS by $0.56. For adjusted operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2024 to be 15.5%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal 2023 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023. We now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.97 to $12.20 or 3% to 5% growth over fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.9 billion. Property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And one moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Thank you. Good morning to all of you. Julie, just a big picture, maybe two simple of a question, but just curious to get your thoughts on where we are in the cycle for IT services spend, because we've been doing sector softness for quite some time now, Accenture has done well, you have very large deal activity come through, short-term cycle stuff is always little pressured as you said, where are we in terms of seeing maybe things bottoming or short-cycle discretionary spend returning?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. I mean, Tien-Tsin, I think it's hard to predict at this point anything other than what we see right now. Right? So what's different than 90 days ago. Well, as we said in December, we really get visibility into our clients' budgets in January, we say that every year, right? And so, as the calendar year, we turn the page, what we saw was a further tightening of spending at our clients. Particularly [indiscernible] our services and particularly on the smaller projects. So from that sort of trend perspective, 90 days ago we didn't see the same level. Now you kind of turn the dial a little bit more constraints and that's where we see the budgets being set for calendar year 2024, right? And as you said though, in this environment we're taking market share and we're seeing building momentum on our strategy to be the reinvention partner with a record 39 clients with bookings over $100 million. So what does that tell you, right? So, the clients understand the importance of the technology-led transformation. And the fundamentals remain the same. There is a lot more reinvention ahead. We're still -- when you look at where is cloud, both migration and modernization, we say about 80% of the opportunities ahead. Data and AI, but 90% of the opportunities ahead. Re platforming in cloud-based platforms. About 65% of that opportunity ahead, based on who has actually adopted that more modern platforms and security. Well, I think security can be kind of forever ahead, but at least 65% ahead. And that's before you get to thinking about areas like digital manufacturing, engineering services, where that technology has only been coming online, even in the last couple of years sort of the modern technology. And of course, customer also extraordinarily early days. So, where we really focused on is meeting clients where they are today. So that prioritize the large transformational deals and then be positioned to capture the spending when it increases. And we see the sort of the industry has been very strong, because all clients have to get there. They need to get to the technology transformation. They need to get the reinvention and that's why you're seeing -- even as the constraints you're seeing that early interest in GenAI. I mean, $1 billion sales in the first-six months of the year, that is the fastest we have ever built sales in an emerging technology. And what it tells you is that, clients understand the importance of AI that they're going to have to reinvent every part of the enterprise and that's exactly where everything we've done for the last decades at Accenture. Being the company that can go from strategy to build, to operations, deepen industry and functional expertise, because the strategy and consulting all comes together for this moment to be the partner for reinvention across the enterprise, not just to build the technology, but to use it to reinvent and that's exactly what you see in these results, which is why I'm super confident about the industry and the future.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. No, I'm confident that Accenture will be there to catch-all that like you said, but maybe as my follow-up with the GenAI bookings any trends on deal size. And in confidence that, that some of these early bookings will convert to become a part of this whole large $100 million plus deal activity across more pull-through from GenAI, that question makes sense.\nJulie Sweet: So couple of things. What you see in our resilience is that, we are doing these bookings over $100 million and that's what kind of layers that. That just gives you that base rate of resilience during this period. As we said, we're seeing further constraint on the smaller projects. That's why you've got the updated guidance, right? But the pace of these larger deals, we feel really good about from a resilience perspective. And then, you know how this straight, you're at the client, you are at the heart of their business, you're really doing the strategic work that's what all these large deals represent. And then as spending increases you catch the pent-up demand and that's kind of how we see it and that's how we've run it in the past. And by the way, of course, as you know, we're really investing inorganically to capture more growth which you also start to see. Particularly at the back-end of our fiscal year. Thanks, Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, good morning. KC, if Accenture does 1% constant currency in the third quarter, that's kind of the midpoint of the range. I guess the implied midpoint for 4Q is a ramp-up to 6% constant currency. What kind of visibility do you have going into a number of the midpoint like that in the fourth quarter?\nKC McClure: Yes. Hi, Bryan. Thanks for your question. And you're right, you're obviously your math is correct, that that would be what our guidance would say. In terms of visibility, look, it's really no different than what we have anytime in the past in this part of the year for our full-year guidance. Obviously, we are not forecasting that the whole year we just have the back-half of the year, there's no difference in visibility as it relates to what we've done in any other time of the year -- any other year at this time. And we do our same at analysis and outlook to provide you with our guidance of the 1% to 3%.\nBryan Keane: Got it, got it. And then, Julie. Just thinking about the clients need to update their data in order to leverage AI and scale. Why isn't that translating into stronger demand in the business, you would think that everybody would turn-around and spend considerably on short-term to get that ramp-up in order to get AI to leverage it, but it doesn't quite translate. I'm just trying to figure out the disconnect there?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, so there is two things. So first of all, it's about prioritization. Right? So their overall constrained on spending. So, you make choices as opposed to it being additive. So they are not able to allocate extra budget, they're prioritizing their budget. So you're seeing more of a substitution right now as opposed to, hey, we need to do this, let's add to the budget and that's tied to the uncertain macro, that's putting people constraint. I had one banker say, if the corporates have put themselves on a diet, given the macro. Right? The second thing, Bryan is, you have to remember that you can't just jump to the great data foundation. You need to be in the cloud. You've got to have modern platforms. And so what you should read into the higher clients -- the clients during these higher bookings rate is that, they're doing the big transformations oftentimes to be ready to put in the data foundation, right? There's only still 40% of workloads are in the cloud. 20% of those roughly haven't been modernized. Many of our clients haven't put in the platform, if you don't have the major ERP platforms that are modern, you don't create a data foundation to fuel GenAI in isolation. So you've got to build the digital core. And as we've said, there's a lot more to go. And that's what's driving these larger complex transformations like, people will not like to do these big transformations in a sense of the other big, they're hard, they're complicated and they need to do them in order to ultimately be able to use the AI, not just in a part of the business or as a proof-of-concept, but really to transform and get the value they now see and so it's -- again, you can't jump to AI, you've got to put all the pieces, and a lot of clients aren't there yet. Which is our opportunity.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thank you for taking the questions.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Bryan.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go-ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to follow-up on the questions around, particularly AI, etcetera. I recognize like everybody is kind of at different stages. How should we think about: first, the timeline in terms of preparing and getting ready to implement news solutions, etcetera, and then moving into the full implementation? And how we should think about that affecting Accenture’s business? And like you mentioned, you've talked about some record bookings or the number of new customers over $100 million, like how that will ramp-in the timeframe?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, so maybe just -- let me just start with like the strategy around capturing the growth opportunity from GenAI. So, this is the same playbook that we have used in every wave of new technology evolution. When we went from mainframe to client-server then to cloud and Software as a Service and then to RPA and AI driven automation when you saw things like myWizard and SynOps. We have the same strategy, the strategy starts with, we want to be the first-mover to help our clients use the technology. And that's why what we're doing with our investments of $3 billion to create solutions for them and you see that coming through with our sales in Generative AI, which, as I've said on earlier, are the fastest we've ever seen in sort of these new technologies where there's a lot of interest and we're the leader. So we want to be the first-mover in helping our clients use it. The second part of our strategy is to be the first-mover in using the technology itself to serve our clients. And we did that would like the digital, with AI automation, with all of our platforms. And with that said, it's a proven formula, because if we invest big to be early and be the first-mover, then we're positioned to capture all the opportunity in our -- with our clients, because they need to adapt it and transform. And as I just went through, that requires a lot the digital core, then you've got to actually use it to change new ways of working to upskill your talent and build new capabilities like responsible AI. When we are able to be the first-mover, which we are already starting now to use GenAI and how we deliver, that enhances our competitive position. It makes us more differentiated and, of course, it also then allows our clients overtime the more we use the GenAI to achieve the results they need at a lower cost, which frees up their investment capacity to do the massive reinvention. And of course, we are in the best positioned to be their partner as they reinvest in using the tech and AI to [Technical Difficulty] lot of the digital core that's got to-be-built, you can't jump that step. It's not a magic technology. But then as you build it, you then have to go function by function to change the ways you work to actually get the productivity and the growth. So we really see this as being kind of the next decade of what our clients are going to be focused on and we are positioning ourselves to be their partner and be the first-mover in both places.\nKC McClure: Yes. And maybe I'll take the layering in question on the larger deals and talk a little bit about how that's going to work for the back-half of the year as it relates to guidance. So we have the larger deals that were terrific in our second quarter and our whole first-half of the year. But you're right, they do layer-in slower than the smaller deals and we see pressure in the volume of our smaller deals. And that's why we have the 1% to 3% guidance for the full-year. Now we do feel-good about delivering to this guidance and what that means for H2, and that really is for a few reasons that we've talked about before, but let me just kind of reiterate. The first is that, our competitive advantage is that we have the ability to invest. You saw us do that in H1 and Julie talked about that, with investing more in acquisitions this year, in the first half than we did all of last year. And that's really important because that drives inorganic growth. But again, we do that really to fuel organic growth, but we see that coming online in the back half of the year. The second thing is that, we have done these larger transformation deals, but also the ones from the previous years. And we see that continuing to benefit us as it relates to revenue as they will layer on in the back half of the year. And that really just speaks to the resilience of our strategy, both in terms of being what Julie has talked about, being where our clients need us and our inorganic strategy to continue to benefit to pivot to scale in new areas of growth. And so, that's how that all comes together in terms of revenue conversion from those larger deals and when they come online, James. And maybe I'll just also add, what that means from a type of work for the entire year. What we now see from the context of the 1% to 3% is, our consulting type of work will be about flattish. And we see our managed services growing to about mid-single digit growth for the year.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thanks for the color to both of you. And then quickly KC, just in terms of that investment. How do we think about like how that affects the margin expansion. I mean typically one, you're doing acquisitions, there a little bit of time before you can start to get people to the same type of trajectory as Accenture on margin expansion, but just trying to get a sense of how we should think about that impacting as well?\nKC McClure: Yes. Thanks for that. Well, first of all, I'm just -- I just want to put out that I'm really pleased with our profitability in the first half of the year and the outlook for profitability for the full year. Our margin is flat, but we have EPS growth for the first half of the year, profit growth of 5%. And that really just points to the rigor and discipline that we continue to operate our business in. But really importantly, as Julie talked about, all the investments we're making in our business and our people continue. So as you look at the back-half of the year, we now see the 10 basis points expansion is where we see it. Again, very important, continue to have high levels of investment in our people and our business. And EPS, we see for the whole year at about 3% to 5%. One thing I will point out just to help all of you. We did benefit from the first-half of the year in our EPS with higher non-operating income, which makes lot of sense on interest income, on our higher cash balance. In the first-half, you see our cash went from 9% to 5%. So great cash, we can -- no concerns will continue with our capital allocation strategy, but just as you model in the back half of the year, you'll see that not surprisingly with lower cash flow will have lower interest income. So just as you're working through your EPS for the first-half and second-half, that's something that you might want to consider.\nJames Faucette: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. So Julie, I'm curious just based on your conversations with leaders, what might be the catalyst here to have clients release spending programs and kind of lean back into shorter cycle work. As economic data generally holds up, are we just in a slower for longer backdrop or just kind of hoping that you can share some color on how you're thinking about a recovery internally and what enterprises really are watching and waiting for?\nJulie Sweet: Look, I think there's going to be a couple dynamics, right? Remember they just set budgets. So we're kind of assuming there are the budgets for their calendar year and we see in general, most of this constraint is tied to the uncertain macro. So those are the kind of things. They set budgets and they've got uncertain macro.\nKC McClure: Yes. And just a reminder that everything that we're talking about in terms of giving guidance. I know all of you know this, but just as a reminder, our fiscal year-ends on August. Right? So there -- it's a little bit over halfway through the calendar year.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, okay, that makes sense. And then as it relates to GenAI, just kind of a revolutionary versus evolutionary kind of questioning here. Just given how much work needs to be done for most clients to really do anything with large language models, how do we interpret that as a driver of your growth? So meaning, does GenAI enabled you to potentially drive a higher-level of growth when spending does become more normal or should we think about this more as a next tech wave that enable comparable levels of normalized growth just because of how long this might all take for large enterprises to get there?\nJulie Sweet: Yes, what I'd say is, this is this is more about -- like we think of this as like prior technology waves. Right? Each one has been a little bit faster in terms of that, but especially when you look at kind of where our clients are on the continuum of building out that digital core, there is a lot to go and you really need that to fully realize it. So we see this is more like our prior kind of the way these things have evolved in the past. Right now, that's what we see.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go-ahead.\nDave Koning: Yes. Hey guys. Thanks so much. I guess my question, are you seeing your clients probably having much lower attrition, just like every company has low employee attrition, right now. Are you seeing them take their own employees, their own IT employees and just do more internally right now? And is that a little bit of just the demand issue right now?\nJulie Sweet: We certainly are seeing -- obviously, our clients have invested in more technology internally at our advice. Right? We've said to them during the pandemic with technology being so important, they should be building up their technologies. So there is clients, they've got a lot of clients, not all of it, because it really depends on your positioning to some of our clients, that's really not the differentiator. So they want a smaller IT and they've got others who built it up and it really depends on where they are. But sure, I mean, we certainly got clients doing more -- doing more in-house as part of it and we've got other clients outsourcing more. So like, it's really all over the map, because it's very company specific as to what makes sense for their strategy.\nDave Koning: Yes. Okay, thanks. And just one quick follow-up for KC. The tax rate, clearly you lowered guidance just on the tax-rate itself. Is that something one-off to this year or is that something now that just seems more normalized?\nKC McClure: Yes. So, there's really four things that every year are the same, that really influence our tax rate. And just really is how those things come together. There are geographic mix of income, any settlements from previous years, any increase that we need to do on prior year tax liabilities, and lastly, the impact of our equity on our tax rate. So these four things really are confluences the same every year, depending on how they fall. That's going to influence where we land on our tax rate. And so, we -- this year we saw them favorably in aggregate. So we're able to keep our 2 point range, but drop by 1%.\nDave Koning: Okay. Well, thank you guys.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go-ahead.\nJamie Friedman: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have a really big picture question. I'm curious, Julie, how you feel about Accenture’s role in the broader context of technology like software and cloud? And I realize in your prior very thoughtful answer about technology architectures. That was a great structure as was your innovation session back on February 16th. But it does seem like other parts of tech are doing better than services. So I'm just interested in your perspective on services in the context of broader tech spending?\nJulie Sweet: No, absolutely. It's a great question. Services are where you can dial back more easily than when you're signing-up for licenses for technology that you need. So you'd imagine and just what we're seeing that, when you are constraining overall spending, your discretionary spending, you go to like service providers where you're saying, I can pause for that. I can wait for that. And at the same time you've got in other parts of it, like with software where you've got to fix things you really need to invest in and you've got different licenses. So it's really not different than other cycles. Services have a bigger opportunity to say, it's a little more discretionary, let's wait. Even if I bought the licenses, I'm going to wait to actually incur the costs, because a lot of times the cost of the services can be significantly higher than the software licenses, because you've got all the change that you've got to do and all that around. So again, we don't see anything sort of different than when you've got an uncertain macro you look around for your discretionary spending and you cut that. And that's why, of course, you're seeing still the big transformations happening because it's not discretionary and they really got to re-platform in that. So it's like nothing mysterious about is kind of what I consider kind of normal in this kind of a macro.\nKC McClure: That's right. An. I think just as a reminder, even with all that we still have the record spend with us with $40 billion of bookings for the first half of the year.\nJamie Friedman: Yes, those are great things. All right, I'll jump back. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you, Julie. Thanks KC.\nKatie O'Conor: Operator we have time for one more question and then Julie will wrap-up the call.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Julie. Hi, KC.\nJulie Sweet: Hi, Ashwin.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Going back to -- Hey. Going back to the question of bookings, are clients actually visiting existing bookings ones that they sign maybe last year and at times prior, relooking at them using the lens of applying sort of rapidly evolving GenAI capabilities. To what extent is that happening and then that kind of implies, obviously -- can we can reuse those past bookings and backlog as an indicator of future growth and how soon that can layer-in?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. I'll take that. Just maybe more just the financial kind of mechanical part of it. We have not seen a change in us working the work that's already been contracted, what we would call our backlog and what we talked about was really spending on new sales, new services and their smaller projects and that's the dynamic that we have factored into our guidance for the year.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. And then the other question was on LearnVantage and Udacity, I thought that was a particularly interesting deal. If you could walk us through maybe the mechanics of that deal? And every company is investing in talent care, there seems to be a bit different approach maybe. Can you just talk about the rationale, the downstream impact and so on?\nJulie Sweet: Sure, thank you. Because it's -- I'm super passionate about what we're doing with LearnVantage, because it is so critical for our clients. Talent is the number one agenda item for CEOs. The number one. And when you think about what reinvention means, the clients have to do and AI rotation and they have to do a talent rotation. And what LearnVantage does is, it first and foremost provides the ability for everything from the Board to the C-Suite to business users, to the technologists to get the technology training they need to make the right decisions on AI, for example. To be able to become deeper in the new technologies. And so it really goes from the Board to the technologist. And with Udacity what we're able to provide is essentially the same approach Accenture uses, right? So, we spent over $1 billion ourselves. You saw our latest average 14 hours per employee. And we have -- we use learning science to learn and do. Most of our clients are unable to do that. The big differentiator for us in the market here is that, we Accenture know when you train someone we have to then put them on a job, and they have to get paid to do something, so they are work ready. So we're bringing that expertise now at scale to our clients. And what Udacity does is the same thing, they use exports mentors, they have a real project work that they then coach people on. So it's that same sort of approach of learn and do, but our companies -- our clients don't have all the work that we do, so Udacity has created this ability. And so -- and it's coupled then with Accenture's deep understanding of what it takes to train and be work ready. So we're really excited about it. Our clients are excited about it, they've been coming to us. We've been doing this learning and this enables us now to do it at scale. And again, we want to be the reinvention partner. So the more that we can fill all of the needs of our clients around that, the better position that we will be. So we see LearnVantage is highly, highly strategic. And by the way, it also has, we have a managed service today to actually manage the learning services that companies are now doing internally, which we also expect to -- we're investing and expect to grow. So, very excited. And then finally, [indiscernible] responsibility is our -- as corporates to bring our people along the journey. And so when people worry about things like AI in displacement, we feel that our ability to bring like who then upskilling expertise to help our clients be able to bring their people is really, really important. It's important for our communities. It's important to their Board’s and we also consider it really important because it's the right thing to do.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it.\nJulie Sweet: Great. So thanks, everyone. In closing. I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support all of our people for what you do every day. To assure you that we are working every day to continue to earn that trust. Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect."},{"symbol":"ACN","quarter":3,"year":2024,"date":"2024-06-20 08:00:00","content":"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Katie O'Conor. Please go ahead.\nKatie O'Conor: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short-time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release, or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie, and everyone joining. And thank you to our 750,000 people around the world who work every day to deliver 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. Before we get into the quarter, I want to thank KC, who's been an excellent partner for these last five years, and our three other extraordinary leaders who are stepping down in the next two quarters, Jean-Marc, Ellyn, and Paul. Each have given over 36 years of service and demonstrated strong stewardship in developing outstanding successors, including Angie, who you all know from her former role as Head of Investor Relations, who will succeed KC on December 1. As always, we are executing a smooth leadership transition to the next generation with our strong bench of great leaders. Now, on to the quarter. I am pleased this quarter to bring to life yet again the resilience and agility of our business, as our actions to remain laser-focused on our clients' needs and quickly adapt to market conditions can be seen in our results, which are building a foundation for stronger growth as we go into Q4 and next fiscal year. As you know, this fiscal year, our client spending developed differently than we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year. And these conditions continue, with clients prioritizing large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue more slowly, while limiting discretionary spending, particularly in smaller projects, with delays in decision-making and a slower pace of spending as well. In response, we have moved quickly to adjust by leveraging our unique strengths, our end-to-end services, including deep industry and functional expertise that enable these large-scale transformations or what we call reinventions. We're also leveraging our deep technology expertise and ecosystem partnerships and our learning machine and culture that gives us the agility to shift to new areas of demand, including, for example, GenAI while continuing to invest at scale for future growth. Here is how these strengths and our strategy are demonstrating results three quarters into the fiscal year. With our clients prioritizing large-scale transformations, we have accelerated our strategy to be the reinvention partner of our clients. Our success is reflected in our bookings of $21.1 billion, including another 23 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, bringing the total of such clients with these bookings to 92 year-to-date, seven more than last year at this time. This focus on being the reinvention partner is an important part of our strategy to return to stronger growth. As we enter next year, as this work ramps, the revenue from these large-scale bookings is expected to continue to layer in throughout the year, and we are also well-positioned to capture increases in discretionary spend when it comes back because of the strategic positioning these deals bring at our clients. We also have leaned into the new area of growth, GenAI, which is comprised of smaller projects as our clients primarily are in experimentation mode, and this quarter we hit two important milestones. With over $900 million in new GenAI bookings this quarter, we now have $2 billion in GenAI sales year-to-date, and we have also achieved $500 million in revenue year-to-date. This compares to approximately $300 million in sales and roughly $100 million in revenue from GenAI in FY 2023. Leading in GenAI positions us to help our clients take the actions needed to reinvent and to benefit from GenAI, which frequently means large-scale transformations. We are also taking an early lead with an eye toward long-term leadership in this critical technology, which is still in the early stages of maturity and adoption, despite its rapid evolution. We have built our expertise in making strategic acquisitions over the last decade, leveraging a strong balance sheet, and we have used this expertise to expand into new growth areas, scale in hot areas and geographies, and continue to build strength in our industry and functional consulting. We deployed $2.3 billion of capital across our geographic markets in Q3 across 12 acquisitions, bringing the total number of acquisitions to 35 with invested capital of $5.2 billion year-to-date as compared to $2.5 billion for the entire FY 2023. As a learning organization and talent creator, we continue to invest in our people with approximately 13 million training hours this quarter. This averages 19 hours per person, representing an increase predominantly due to GenAI as we continue to prepare our workforce for the infusion of GenAI across our business in the coming years. We also continue to steadily increase our data and AI workforce, reaching approximately 55,000 skilled data and AI practitioners against our goal of doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 by the end of FY 2026. We continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share, with revenues of $16.5 billion for the quarter, up 1.4% in local currency and slightly above the midpoint of our FX adjusted range. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 10 basis points and delivered free cash flow of $3 billion. I want to congratulate our 97,000 people we have promoted around the world through June 1, including 702 to Managing Director and 64 to Senior Managing Director, reflecting our commitment to providing vibrant career paths. We are recognized as a Top 10 Place to Work in 10 countries, representing more than 70% of our people, number two in Argentina, Brazil, and the Philippines, number four in Singapore, number five in Costa Rica, Finland, and Indonesia, number seven in the US, and number 10 in Chile on the Great Place to Work list of Best Workplaces and number two on Business Today's Best Companies to Work For in India. And in recognition of our strong brand, we are proud to earn the number 20 position on Kantar BrandZ's prestigious Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list, our highest rank to date, with an 11% increase in brand value to $81.9 billion. Our scale across strategy, consulting, technology, and operations, and our breadth and depth across industries and functions make us uniquely capable of helping our clients reinvent using technology, data, AI, and new ways of working. Before turning to KC, I want to give a little more color on our acquisitions this quarter, which yet again demonstrate the strategic importance of both our ability to invest, and our expertise in identifying, attracting, and integrating great companies joining Accenture. Let's start with new areas of growth. We completed our acquisition of Udacity to scale our technology learning and training services and to help our clients reskill and upskill their people. Udacity is a critical part of our LearnVantage digital learning platform, which we announced last quarter as a new area of growth for the future. Building on our expertise in customer-focused consulting, we invested to help drive our clients' growth agendas. We acquired Unlimited, an award-winning customer engagement agency with a deep understanding of human behavior as evidenced by its proprietary human understanding lab and AI-powered data insights platform. We acquired The Lumery in Australia, a marketing technology consultancy that helps leading organizations deliver seamless customer experiences and transform their marketing services. It provides industry and platform consulting services, including marketing, advisory, and planning, implementation across entire technology stacks, operational excellence, and simplification. We closed our acquisition of GemSeek in Bulgaria, a leading customer experience analytics provider helping global businesses understand customers through insights, analytics, and AI-powered predictive models. And we closed MindCurv, a global digital -- a cloud-native digital [indiscernible] experience and data analytics company specializing in composable software, digital engineering, and commerce services. Now, let's turn to scaling and hot industries. We acquired Cognosante, a provider of innovative technology solutions for US federal health, defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies. With this acquisition, federal services is creating a new federal health portfolio for its business. We invested in Customer Management IT and SirfinPA, which will provide the public sector with technology, support, and justice and public safety in Italy. We see public service and, in particular, health, intelligence, and defense as highly strategic industry focus areas globally for the next several years. And we invested in Teamexpat, focusing on testing integration for lithography systems in the semiconductor industry, another attractive industry segment. Our investment in Flo Group, a leading European consultancy and Oracle business partner, who specializes in global supply chain logistics is helping us scale in supply chain, also a major growth area. Finally, we're scaling in attractive geographic markets. We acquired CLIMB, a technology-based consultancy based in Japan, where we continue to experience very strong revenue growth. Over to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie. And thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our Q3 results, which were in line with our expectations and reflect continued investment at scale. We continue to serve as a trusted partner for our clients, while running our business with rigor and discipline. Now, let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 1.4% local currency with mid-single digit growth or higher in seven of our 13 industries, including public service, industrial, high-tech, life sciences, energy, utilities, and health. We also continue to see improvement in our CMT industry group. And we continue to take smart share. As a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about a third of our addressable market. We use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions to the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. Adjusted operating margin was 16.4%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q3 last year, and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3 billion and returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we've invested $5.2 billion across 35 acquisitions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $21.1 billion for the quarter, representing 22% growth in US dollars and 26% growth in local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.3. Consulting bookings were $9.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Managed services bookings were $11.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.5. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.5 billion, a 1% decline in US dollars and a 1.4% increase in local currency, and slightly above the midpoint of our FX adjusted guidance range, as the FX headwind was approximately 2% compared to the 1% headwind estimated at the beginning of the quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a decline of 3% in US dollars and a decline of 1% in local currency. Managed services revenues were $8 billion, up 2% US dollars and up 4% local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services and strategy and consulting grew low single digits and operations was flat. Turning to our geographic markets, in North America, revenue grew 1% local currency, led by growth in public service, partially offset by decline in banking and capital markets. In EMEA, revenues declined 2% local currency with growth in public service, offset by declines in banking and capital markets and communications and media. Revenue growth in Italy was offset by a decline in France. In growth markets, revenue grew 8% local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets and industrial. Revenue growth was driven by Argentina and Japan, partially offset by a decline in Australia. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.4%, consistent with the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6%, compared to 10.5% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.3%, compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want you to note that in Q3 of FY 2024 and FY 2023, we recorded $77 million and $347 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, respectively. These costs decreased operating margin by 40 basis points and EPS by $0.08 this quarter and operating margin by 210 basis points and EPS by $0.42 in Q3 of last year. In Q3 of last year, we also recognized a gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting an adjusted operating margin of 16.4%, an increase of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.13, compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.19 in the third quarter last year. Days sales outstanding was 43 days, compared to 43 days last quarter and 42 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $124 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $5.5 billion, compared with $9 billion at August 31. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the third quarter we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $1.4 billion, an average price of $320.41 per share. As of May 31, we had approximately 3.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $811 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on August 15, a 15% increase over last year. In closing, we feel good about our results in Q3 and are now working hard to deliver Q4. We remain focused on capturing growth opportunities while continuing to invest in our business for long-term market leadership. Now let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more of the same in terms of the demand environment. Now let me give a little context on how we're executing our strategy to be the reinvention partner of choice and why we're uniquely positioned to be helping our clients on AI. It is important to remember that while there is a near universal recognition now of the importance of AI, which is at the heart of reinvention, the ability to use GenAI at scale varies widely with clients on a continuum. With those which have strong digital cores genuinely seeking to move more quickly, while most clients are coming to the realization of the investments needed to truly implement AI across the enterprise, starting with a strong digital core from migrating applications and data to the cloud, building a new cognitive layer, implementing modern ERP and applications across the enterprise to a strong security layer. And nearly all clients are finding it difficult to scale GenAI projects because the AI technology is a small part of what is needed. To reinvent using technology, data, and AI, you must also change your processes and ways of working, rescale and upscale your people, and build new capabilities around responsible AI, all with a deep understanding of industry, function, and technology to unlock the value. And many clients need to first find more efficiencies to enable scaled investment in their digital cores and all these capabilities, particularly in data foundations. In short, GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to more aggressively go after cost, build the digital core, and truly change the ways they work, which creates significant opportunity for us. And this is why clients are coming to us. We are able to help our clients with this AI rotation because of our broad services across strategy and consulting technology and operations, as well as everything customer through Song and digital manufacturing and engineering through Industry X and our relevance across the functions of the enterprises and 13 industries. Our privileged position in the technology ecosystem has never been more important. We are working closely with our ecosystem partners to help our clients understand the right data and AI backbone that is needed and how to achieve tangible business value. Now let me give you a few examples of the complex work of reinvention and building a digital core. We are partnering with Currys, a leading European technology retailer to unlock new growth and cost savings by accelerating its adoption of new technologies. First, we will move their operations from a legacy data center to a new cloud platform using pre-built and customized solutions to create a powerful digital core. This unified data foundation allows us to deploy automation and generative AI in key growth areas, such as repair centers, customer service, e-commerce, procurement, and in-store experiences, delivering faster, more efficient services to their customers. The move to a new platform supports the company's sustainability goals, reducing energy consumption by transitioning to a more efficient cloud infrastructure. Now, Currys' employees will be empowered to serve their customers better by offering high-touch experiences, both online and in-stores. We're working with Independence Health Group, IHG, a leading health organization headquartered in Southeastern Pennsylvania on a transformation journey to modernize end-to-end operations, improving the way they serve current and future generations of customers. We will help migrate nearly 2 million members to a new digital-first platform, expected to drive immediate improvements in existing business processes. This will lay the foundation to leverage advanced technology and generative AI to proactively manage members' health. We are also helping reskill and retrain their operations staff, creating opportunities for employee development. With this reinvention, Independence continues its ongoing efforts to increase service quality, improve experiences, and enable better health outcomes, positioning them for new areas of growth in the rapidly changing healthcare landscape. Digital core work also requires deep industry expertise as we work with our clients to design the right tech, data, and AI to reinvent their enterprise and their industry. We are helping Macy's, an iconic American retailer with a technology modernization effort. As a strategic technology execution partner, we will migrate their mainframe systems to a cloud platform, a move that will enhance their operational efficiency and scalability. This will allow Macy's to be more agile and enable growth. We are helping the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the regulatory body responsible for the country's banking and insurance sector with a digital transformation to strengthen the financial system's stability and contribute to growth, innovation, and diversification in the sector, in line with the UAE's national vision. Our program will deliver advanced analytics along with AI-driven automation to improve supervisory capabilities and streamline activities for licensed financial institutions by creating best-in-class processes to support regulatory compliance. We will also modernize the bank's enterprise data management by implementing a single unified portal to provide a holistic view of the financial services ecosystem, all of which will enhance the UAE's position as a global financial center. We are partnering with Virgin Media O2, a leading carrier services provider in the UK to support regional businesses to realize the promise of 5G, opening new revenue streams and stimulating growth in the telco market. We will bring to market solutions built on our edge orchestration platform, which combines edge computing, data AI, GenAI, and embedded security. This will enable use cases such as quality inspections, safe workplace management, and behavior monitoring to improve operations and customer experience. Whether it's enabling safe communication on building sites, creating a fan experience while handling crowds and busy venues, or supporting vital devices and clinician workflow in healthcare, Virgin Media O2 can now offer businesses a range of flexible, secure, and affordable solutions that boost efficiency, growth, and performance. And with our managed services and customer operations, we can work together with Virgin Media O2 to scale this growth. Security is a critical part of reinvention in the digital core. We saw continued very strong double-digit growth in our security business this quarter. We are partnering with the US Navy to enhance its cybersecurity operations with cutting-edge capabilities that will strengthen its data security posture and support mission readiness. More than ever, data and information are critically important to national security. Our solution sets are configured to provide defensive cyber operations across Navy networks to help safeguard digital assets and mission operations. Together, we will help ensure the US Navy can combat evolving cyber threats, protect our sailors at sea, and defend American interests around the world. Once clients have a strong foundation, they can explore new opportunities to drive growth and efficiencies with GenAI. We are helping a leading global food and beverage company who already built a strong digital core as part of its reinvention journey to now leverage the power of generative AI to create new value. Together, we developed a digital shelf console pilot, a GenAI engine that accelerates content creation for e-commerce and optimizes it to drive sales. The engine empowers marketers to audit and customize content at scale, expected to reduce time to deliver one year's worth of content to just eight working days and save costs of up to 80% quickly and effectively. Once they scale, this enables the company to produce more targeted content with significant time and cost efficiency, increase sales, and transform customer experiences. We have partnered with National Australia Bank, one of the country's largest financial institutions to strategically implement and scale generative AI to create material value at speed, enhance relationship-driven customer service, and drive operational efficiencies. We worked on a methodical build of a secure and robust GenAI platform built within the bank's existing strategic data platform with the creation of 200 generative AI use cases in backlog. To date, over 20 use cases have been tested across the bank with eight of these enterprise-grade pilots underway and a number of those scaling and already delivering value. We also co-created a methodology for delivering GenAI projects from experiments to scalable deployment, ensuring each stage delivers tangible business benefits. While doing so, National Australia Bank and Accenture are putting safety at the core of the approach through responsible AI and risk policies alongside developing in-house AI expertise and literacy. One of the areas of richest opportunities for our clients is customer experience transformation, which uses the unique capabilities of Song across creative customer insights and deep technology expertise. Song grew mid-single digits this quarter. We are helping Saudia Airlines, the national flag carrier of Saudi Arabia, to launch an innovative digital platform to transform the travelers experience. Powered by GenAI, the platform will provide a one-stop solution enabling customers to seamlessly plan their journeys, book flights, and modify their trips in just a few words, all while providing a personalized and conversational experience. The platform is continuously evolving and will integrate more services over time. This modernization will support Saudia Airlines' vision of redefining the standards of travel in a digital world. We continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. Industry X grew high single digits in Q3. We are supporting a large Asia-Pacific automobile manufacturer on their reinvention towards software-defined vehicles. We will help accelerate software development and create a software center of excellence to optimize quality, cost pressures, and delivery times. This center of excellence will manage four key workstreams, advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle infotainment, electrical and electronics, and powertrain. By leveraging our expertise and strategic partnerships, we are empowering them to strengthen and evolve its in-vehicle software, providing advanced functions and services throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. This enables the company to drive innovation, enhance driver and passenger experiences, and realize the full potential of software-defined vehicles. And we will continue to leverage all of our strengths to manage the current macro conditions and constrained spending while investing in leadership for the future. Back to you, KC.\nKC McClure: Thanks, Julie. Now turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.05 billion to $16.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated 2% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be negative 0.7 compared to fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal 2024, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% of growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, which assumes an inorganic contribution approaching 3%. We continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2024 to be 15.5%, a 10 basis point expansion of fiscal 2023 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023. We now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.85 to $12, or 2% to 3% growth over fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you so much, and congrats to KC and Angie. I'm excited for both of you guys. I just wanted to ask upfront, just for Julie, maybe you mentioned stronger growth next year. Hoping you can just elaborate on that at a high level. I know there's a lot of moving pieces. On one hand, you have a big backlog, a lot of large deals. You have strong inorganic growth, but on the other hand, the sector is struggling with this weak discretionary spend, and there's uncertainty with global elections in the second half of the year. So just -- I know you can't give formal guidance until next year. I know consensus is at, what, 6%? Can you just give us maybe just some high-level considerations that are worth underlining as we're recasting our outlook for next year? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Sure, and thanks for the question, Tien-tsin. So, let's just anchor on our strategy for growth and what you're seeing in three quarters into the year, because obviously, expectations at the beginning of this year were different in terms of how things develop with spending. So, what did we do? We leaned into what do clients need, and they need these reinventions, they need these big, large-scale transformations. And so, what you've seen us to do is, like, you've got to go with what the clients need, and that's what they're buying. And so, we have accelerated our leaning into these large transformation deals, which is why you see that we have seven more than last year at this time of clients with bookings of over $100 million. Now, these convert to revenue more slowly, but as we're accelerating, you'll know that they ramp up and they will start to layer in. And we are very uniquely positioned in this market to be able to do these large-scale transformations because they require the combination of services, everything from the ability to help them move faster through our managed services, our industry expertise. Everyone wants to do that with the eye towards GenAI, so even though the transformations are often in preparation for GenAI, they want to work with the partner who really understands GenAI, and so how do we get there faster. And so, as you think about the reinvention strategy, that's a strategy we've been executing for a couple of years, and we uniquely can lean in, and that -- you're seeing the results of that this quarter with the acceleration of -- compared to last year, of clients with that level of bookings and those, of course, then ramp next year. The second is, our leaning into where we are seeing growth in smaller deals because remember that discretionary spending is constrained, overall spending constrained, and particularly in smaller projects. But what did we do, right? We see GenAI as the new growth. We have an incredible ability to pivot our people. You can see the specialists in data and AI growing. We started at 40,000, we're at 55,000 now against our goal of 80,000 by the end of 2026. We're also training our people. You saw that big increase, because we're preparing our people. You're now doing a transformation. It may not be GenAI, but you have to understand GenAI. And so, we're uniquely able to train our people at scale to understand GenAI. And how is that translating? We'll look at our bookings this quarter now getting to $2 billion, three quarters into the year as compared to $300 million last year and $500 million in revenue. So starting to be meaningful, right? In terms of the numbers, we were at $100 million for all of last year. So we expect to continue to lean into GenAI. And what it's doing is very interesting from where we were, say, three quarters ago. It's acting as the catalyst to understand what you have to do. So I'll finish here and then I'll just, of course, mention our ability to invest in inorganic. But right now from a perspective of like the pull through, we're still reprioritizing. But every other GenAI project now is leading to some data project, because people are understanding, hey, this is a great technology and I'm not ready. So we feel really good about being very well positioned as spending increases, when it does increase because of what we're doing. And then finally, remember we invest in acquisitions to drive organic growth. Like that is -- so it's all about future growth. And I gave a lot in the script today to just help bring to life just how strategic our ability to invest is as we think about future growth. So not trying to comment at all on FY 2025. We'll call it like we see it. But we also want to be clear that our strategy is working and these deals will ramp up.\nKC McClure: Yes, maybe I'll just add, Tien-tsin, just how we feel just within this fiscal year. So, we're very pleased with where we landed in Q3. When you look to Q4, we do have, and you see that in our growth rate, a clear uptick in our growth rate for the fourth quarter. And I think importantly included in that is the expectation that our consulting type of work in Q4, Tien-tsin, will return to growth and that we haven't had growth in consulting type of work since Q2 of last year.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Good. No, thank you both for that. I'll be less wordy with my follow-up. Just on the inorganic piece, can this pace continue?\nKC McClure: I'll let Julie talk about -- add on here. But in terms of our -- let's talk about capital allocation. And we've always said this, we have the ability, and I think it's a differentiator of ours, to be able to invest and approach the market as whenever we see something that we want to execute. And that remains unchanged. And we've been able -- and you've seen us do that over all the different business cycles. And importantly, when we do that, we're able to continue all parts of our capital allocation in terms of share buybacks and dividends as well. So, from a financial standpoint, we have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to continue to flex up and down as we see fit from a capital allocation standpoint, Tien-tsin.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, Tien-tsin, and I think we'll make the decision as we go into next year as to what level we want to drive for next year. So, I think we'll comment next quarter.\nTien-Tsin Huang: That's perfect. I know you've been able to amplify the growth of what you bought. So, that's why I asked. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks so much. One thing I noticed, debt was up to $1.6 billion or so. Sequentially, it was the highest. Really, in 20 years, you've almost had no debt, and you have a lot of cash. So, I guess, what's the strategy around borrowing money now? And maybe it's just geographic cash positions, too.\nKC McClure: Yes. No, that's a great question. So, in terms of our cash, you said that we started the year at $9 billion, and now we're little bit -- we are about $5.5 billion. And we do have some debt. It's very small, as you mentioned, for a company of our size. We do have a -- we had a credit facility that we put in right during the pandemic, and we continue to have a credit facility. It's about $5.5 billion. It's a five-year credit facility and what you just see, Dave, is that we're just exercising some of that credit facility, kind of normal treasury operation.\nDave Koning: Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, margins this year up at the lower end of kind of normal and certainly scale, just the growth this year being a little slower, maybe the acquisitions. And just as we kind of look forward, the margin puts and takes, how should we think that with acquisition spending maybe a little higher, does the next few quarters remain kind of putting a little pressure on margins or how should we think of just the moving parts of margins going forward?\nKC McClure: Yes, sure. So I'll just obviously keep my comments to this year, to 2024, but -- and maybe I'll just point out where we are and what we are continuing to assume. So we stated last quarter that we'd be at 10 basis points of operating margin expansion and we reconfirmed that, Dave, for the full year, again this quarter, and we feel confident in our ability to do that. So if you look at -- we run our business to operating margin. If you look at gross margin and overall what we've been saying on pricing and just importantly, when we talk about pricing, we mean the margin on the work that we sell. What I think is really important for us is that, we've been able to operate our business with rigor and discipline in how we run ourselves in an operation -- in efficient operations of Accenture and be our own best credential as we absorb kind of higher selling costs, which you would expect. We're looking at our record $60 billion of bookings and also the continued pressure and pricing that we've had across the business. So with that, we feel really good. And if you look at it, we grew 1% in quarter one. As an example, we were able to do 20 basis points of margin expansion. We grew 1% this quarter, and we were able to do 10 basis points of margin expansion. So we feel good about the way we run our business with rigor and discipline.\nDave Koning: Great. Thanks and nice bookings.\nKC McClure: Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning and congrats, KC. A great run at Accenture. You were awesome. So, I want to ask on managed services on the bookings, the $11.8 billion, that was an outsized number. How much of that is new bookings versus renewals? And maybe give us some flavor on what caused that spike in growth.\nKC McClure: Yes. Maybe I will give you the -- I'll talk a little bit about the numbers. In terms of, it is a record bookings for managed services. As Julie's -- and as we've been talking, it is obviously based on the larger transformational deals that we're doing. Well, those larger transformational deals, just to be clear, Bryan, they do have both consulting and outsourcing -- excuse me, managed services type of work with them. They do have, as you would expect, a larger portion of managed services type of work. So when you see what we were able to do this year, we're already at 92, seven more than last year. And we did have a very strong managed services bookings, as you noted, in Q3. We don't really do a breakout in terms of extensions or new, but there's always -- we always have a healthy mix, I would say, of both. That's what we strive to over rolling four quarters in our business always and no difference there.\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. And just maybe a little color, Bryan. As you think about this idea of reinvention, Virgin Media O2 was a great example, because there, right, we have a combination using our Edge platform to provide -- help O2 provides -- Virgin Media O2 to provide these new services. And at the same time, we're supporting it with our customer operations, supporting their growth so that they can scale. And right now, clients, of course, they're looking for growth, they're also looking for transformation and efficiency. The other thing I'd say is, this is a great example of how we're embracing GenAI. You've heard us talk in the past about our myWizard platform, which helps in our managed services. We now -- that's become Gen Wizard and we're seeing that our embracing -- early embracing of using Gen AI where it's ready to be used has been a real differentiator in our technology managed services. So, we're very focused on helping our client, who move faster using our expertise and leverage our digital investments in order for them to transform and reinvent faster and you're seeing that focus.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And just a follow-up, just looking at some of the dimensions breakout, when I look at operations being flat, just any call-outs for that. I know it was negative last quarter, so it's turned a little bit here, but just trying to understand the growth there and the prospects. Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, no, it's -- we're really pleased that it's, that ticked up this quarter and it's a very strategic part of our business. Think about it really is like sort of two-ways, right? So we remain number-one in our industry in finance and accounting and we're embracing again GenAI there to help differentiate our platform. And so, there's a focus that we're seeing in our clients as they're saying, okay, we need to -- we really understand how much more we need to digitize and we need to do that in the enterprise, they're excited about our ability over-time. Again, it's very early days still in Gen AI over-time to help build our -- we're building our SynOps platform, we're building in GenAI and that helps them have less to build-in in their enterprise side by partnering with us. And so that's -- we think a really great differentiator. And then we continue to diversify into areas that are in the core of our business, whether -- core of our industries for our clients, whether it's claims and underwriting and insurance, or supply-chain for consumer goods and industrial or core banking in the financial services. So we feel really good about the business and kind of continue -- and its continued prospects.\nBryan Keane: Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.\nRod Bourgeois: Hey guys, and very best wishes to KC as well. Julie, you mentioned that the demand environment is sort of more of the same. At the same time, it appears you've seen some growth mending in certain key areas. I'm particularly interested in the growth improvement in the CMT vertical and in strategy and consulting. Can you talk about what's enabling those growth improvements and a sense of the outlooks for CMT and S&C? Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: So, really want to compliment our entire team on the work that they're doing with our clients in CMT. So, as we've been talking about that for now for a little while and we start to see things like the Virgin Media O2 deal. So our teams are working with our clients on what do they need. And they're focused on getting rid of technology debt, because that's critical in order to use some of these new technologies. They're focused on using the new technologies. So we have a number of clients that -- while it's still small, are working on GenAI. And then being very focused on efficiencies. And then finally network. So, really across the board what I would say is the industry was challenged. We have been just focused on going to where they need help and you're seeing that result in our results. And then on strategy and consulting, again, it's all about being focused on what do our clients need. And so, we've pivoted many more people, for example, toward cost and strategy. So cost takeout is a big theme, and particularly for our strategy. We are seeing a lot of growth still in things like implementing modern ERP platforms with the focus on the digital core. And again, at Accenture, it's not just technology, right? It's about we're the number one player with all of these technology ecosystem players, but our clients want to do it faster. They need the industry expertise. And so, you saw a number of examples in the script about how we're putting in these platforms and we're doing so within an industry context. And so, I'd say cost takeout and move the cloud data platforms wrapped around with industry and functional expertise, that's where we're seeing the growth. And we just continue to remain laser focused on more people, more focus, working with the clients on what they need to buy.\nRod Bourgeois: Great. Thanks for that. And you're seeing revenue mix incrementally shift into managed services, and I'm curious if you think some of that mix shift towards managed services is due to secular forces, or are you purely seeing that mix shift as just a cyclical phenomenon?\nKC McClure: Yes, I think, it's -- in terms of what the real driver is, it's the larger deals that have a little bit of both in those -- both components of a sector and cyclical and what you're talking about. So it really is just based on the larger deal.\nJulie Sweet: So just think about Accenture is very uniquely positioned in this market. Clients are prioritizing large scale transformations. And doing those and getting the efficiencies and moving faster, managed services is a highly strategic component of being able to do that. And this is where Accenture, with such scale in both strategy, in both consulting type of work with managed services is really able to lean into what are clients buying now.\nRod Bourgeois: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning and congrats KC and the other leaders on the retirements and appointments. First question I wanted to ask on the consulting existing revenue-base performance, can you just talk about how base business runoff kind of progressed within the minus 1% local currency performance? I heard your comment on the 4Q consulting or just returning to growth. I'm trying to understand if that's a reflection of sustainable stabilization potentially and really gauge whether you're reaching a point where the new consulting bookings conversion should more than offset the existing base runoff moving ahead.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. So, Brian, in terms of what we'll give -- what we'll talk about is really is what I just mentioned on Q4. I guess -- and I understand what you mean by a base runoff. We don't really think of it that way. We kind of look at it as maybe our terms will be whether we have booked and backlog and what are we already -- and what's new coming in from these sales. And so, I get -- so just kind of going with those two points, the way we evaluate and we talk about it, Brian, is from a year-over-year basis, looking at both the components of what we've already sold for the next quarter and then what we see in our pipeline and how we see those sales will convert to revenue, that's how we kind of assess what we think that we will be overall. And again, very pleased that consulting -- we do feel that and see that it will return to growth. And I think it's a milestone that we haven't had in a number of quarters, so we'll pleased with that. And we'll comment on anything else for next year, next year, I mean in September.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then bookings, obviously, very solid here. Can you just comment on pipeline and any bookings expectations worth calling out for 4Q?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Overall, we feel good about our pipeline. And we don't put -- we don't give guidance to next quarter bookings. But we feel good.\nBryan Bergin: Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on the acquisition activity. It's obviously been really robust, providing a lot of good opportunities. Can you give us any sense collectively across the acquisitions you've been doing and maybe what you are looking at in terms of what the growth rates of those businesses are generally or collectively when you do the acquisitions? And I know there's a target to accelerate those, how the growth rates tend to change as those companies are absorbed into [index center] (ph), even if directionally.\nJulie Sweet: Yes, I mean, I think in terms of -- make sure I'm answering your question is, when we look at overall at our acquisitions, they all come with -- they're typically higher growth business cases that we have from the companies that we buy and we have a base case that comes with the organization and we assess that growth rate. And then we obviously put in pretty significant synergy cases that are -- without going through kind of metrics that are a pretty high bar for those acquisitions to deliver to, along with a broader center. And that's why integration is so important in what we do, because we're not just having a great business case, that is maybe half of what you need to do, but the key really is in how you integrate to deliver to that, and we have a very strong track record. And so, what you'll see is, you could just maybe get the sense to your question, is look at how many we've done over the last five years and you can see how we've been able to continue to grow our business throughout that time. And it is really continuing to fill our organic growth.\nJames Faucette: Got it. And then quickly, one of the areas where you've leaned in on and was mentioned in the prepared remarks is the government and healthcare sector, really strong growth there obviously. How should we be thinking about that as a long-term or medium-term potential grower in that segment and any -- and how are you thinking about the investment needed to continue to drive that? Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks. We feel really good about that vertical. Obviously there's a lot of transformation that's going on in public service. You see health is a big driver, defense is a big driver. There's a lot of infrastructure support, whether it's IRA in the U.S. or what the EU has been doing as well. And of course, a lot of the digital transformation hasn't happened in the public service and health, And so, we see that now being the time and you're seeing that in the results. So we feel very confident and we think about the investment like we do all our industries. I mean, remember, we have 13 industry groups. We have -- the diversification is a key part of both our resilience and our growth strategy. And so, at any given time, we're investing differently depending on the growth trajectory. And as we called out this quarter, we've been investing significantly in public service, because we see the next several years this being a big growth area and we're making those investments now.\nKatie O'Conor: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Okay. That question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Many thanks. And first, Casey and Paul, special congratulations as you make the transition. I wanted to ask a question, and I'll just make it concurrently in the interest of time. And Julie, I think I'll direct this to you. Number one, on BPO, one of your competitors just talked pretty openly about pricing's been under pretty material duress as of late, and I wondered if you would echo that? And I'm really curious as to why. Why do you think pricing has been under duress? And how do you think about impacting future growth? And then the second area that I wanted to ask about is, Song. Thank you for the comment on mid-single digit growth. And I'm really interested how you think GenAI will impact over your digital agency over the next 12 to 24 months. And the reason I ask the question is, we also spend a lot of time with companies like Adobe that have significant -- generative AI is going to have a significant impact on digital agencies. And some of the agencies are talking about seat reductions because of the value associated with generative AI. And I'm just wondering if you could comment on how you think generative AI will impact the growth potential of Song. And that's it for me. Many thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Great. KC, why don't you quickly cut pricing, and then I'll do Song.\nKC McClure: Keith, I would say just in terms of pricing, and we've been commenting on this for quite some time. You are correct in that, we've had overall in our entire business continued pricing pressure. So, I mean, that's the way I would reflect on that statement -- on your question [indiscernible].\nJulie Sweet: Yes, it's overall is a tight market, So that's what you normally see. On Song, here's where we are so unique, because our business is not an agency business, right? The agencies are part of an incredibly differentiated value proposition where you have creative and technology and digital and by the way managed services. And so, we see this as a huge opportunity because we are embracing it as fast as possible to help our clients get value, but we put it together with all of these other services. So we were happy to see the uptick in growth this quarter with Song and long term where we really think it's great. And remember, this is our playbook, right? We embrace technology. We've done it in every wave. We've done it when we did managed services. Remember in 2015, we had SynOps and myWizard. Our business is to help our clients be more efficient and grow. That is what we do. And we use technology in how we deliver it. And we help them use technology and how they operate. And so, we see GenAI as yet another way that we're going to embrace it. We're going to be fast. And we're going to do what we do for clients. And that is a very exciting opportunity, so we feel really good about our Song business. Great. So, thanks everyone for the questions and the time today. In closing I want to again, as always, thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support, and all of our people for what you're doing for our clients and for each other every day. Thanks so much for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference.

Welcome to Accenture's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the conference over to our host, Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatie O'Conor: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full fiscal 2024 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; KC McClure, our current Chief Financial Officer; and Angie Park, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before Angie provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking, and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release, or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, Katie, and everyone joining. And thank you to our 774,000 people around the world who have worked every day to be at the center of our clients' business and deliver 360 degree value for all our stakeholders. Our performance this year clearly demonstrates the resilience and agility of our business model, the power of our scale and reinvention in action. FY '24 was marked by a challenging market environment, and we have rapidly shifted to where our clients are buying, large reinventions that utilize the scale of Accenture's expertise and ecosystem relationships. And we have yet again put reinvention into action at Accenture with our significant investment and yearly (ph) leadership in what we believe will be the most transformative technology of the next decade, GenAI. As a result, over the last four quarters, we have successfully positioned Accenture for strong growth in FY ‘25. When market conditions improve, we will be well positioned to capitalize them. In FY ‘24, we continue to deliver on our enduring shareholder value proposition to grow faster than the market and take share, deliver earnings growth and margin expansion while investing at scale with strong free cash flow, disciplined capital allocation and significant cash return to shareholders. Turning to our results and the foundation for growth we have built for FY '25. With our clients prioritizing large scale transformations, we doubled down on our strategy to be the reinvention partner of our clients. Our success is reflected in our full fiscal year bookings of $81 billion, representing 14% growth in local currency, including 33 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the total of such bookings to 125 for the year, 19 more than last year. We are proud to now have 310 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships, an increase of 10 from last year, expanding our base of deep client relationships and the vantage point we have on the market. We delivered revenues of $65 billion for the year, representing 2% growth in local currency, while continuing to take market share on a rolling four quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 10 basis points and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 2%, while continuing to significantly invest in our business and our people with $6.6 billion in Strategic Acquisitions, $1.2 billion in R&D, and $1.1 billion in Learning and Development. We generated free cash flow of $8.6 billion allowing us to return $7.8 billion of cash to shareholders. We completed the business optimization actions we announced in March 2023 to reduce structural costs. For the full fiscal year, we had $3 billion in new GenAI bookings, including $1 billion in Q4. And for the full fiscal year, we had nearly $900 million in revenue. The magnitude of this achievement is seen in the comparison to FY '23, where we had approximately $300 million in sales and roughly $100 million in revenue from GenAI. This was an area where our clients continued to buy small deals, and we focused on accelerating our growth here. We have continued to steadily increase our data and AI workforce, reaching approximately 57,000 practitioners against our goal of 80,000 by the end of FY '26. We invested in our people to continue to develop their marketable skills and to help us reinvent our services using GenAI. Our people had approximately 44 million training hours this year, representing an increase of 10%, predominantly due to GenAI training. In addition to being a talent creator through our investment in learning, our talent strategy to succeed over the next decade is to have the best access to talent and to unlock the potential of our talent through, among other actions, ensuring our people feel they are net better off for working at Accenture across four dimensions: marketable skills, working for a purpose, well-being financial, mental and physical and relationships, where our people feel they belong and can thrive. In addition, our leadership in the market requires that we lead in innovation, which in turn requires access to broad pools of talent that provide the variety of perspectives, observations and insights, which are essential to continuously innovate. These strategies depend on us fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, and our superior execution of these strategies is demonstrated by our global recognition for the third year with the number one spot on the FTSE, Global Diversity and Inclusion Index, an objective measurement of over 15,000 organizations and our recent achievement of having 50-50 gender equality in our advanced technology centers in India, which have over 220,000 people. Our long-term growth depends on thriving communities, and we continue to successfully create value in the communities where we operate, such as our work helping address the United Kingdom's digital inclusion gap, partnering with Tech [indiscernible] on a new program, regenerative AI, that aims to empower people and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities across the country to build their digital skills. Finally, I want to acknowledge how proud we are to have earned the number two spot on Times World's Best Companies list and the top spot on the World's Best Management Consulting Firms list by Forbes. Over to you KC.\nKC McClure: Thank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We're very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which were aligned to our expectations and reflect improvement across all dimensions of our business. We continue to invest for long-term market leadership, while delivering significant value for our shareholders. So let me begin by summarizing a few highlights for the quarter. Revenue grew 5% in local currency, driven by mid-single digit growth or higher in seven of our 13 industries, including public service, industrial, software and platforms, health, high tech, energy, and life sciences. We had growth in all three markets, all three services as well as return to growth in consulting type of work for the first time in six quarters. Organic revenue improved as well to slightly positive growth, and we continue to take market share. Adjusted operating margin was 15%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q4 last year. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our business and our people. We delivered adjusted EPS of $2.79, which represents 3% growth compared to adjusted EPS last year. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.2 billion and returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. With those high level comments, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $20.1 billion for the quarter, representing 21% growth in U.S. dollars and 24% growth in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Managed services were $11.6 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.4 billion above the mid-point of our guided range, reflecting a 3% increase in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency. Managed services revenue were $8.1 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services and strategy and consulting both grew mid-single digits and operations grew low-single digits. Turning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue grew 6% in local currency driven by growth in public service and industrial. In EMEA, revenue grew 2% local currency led by growth in public service and life sciences, partially offset by a decline in banking and capital markets. Revenue growth was driven by Italy and the United Kingdom, partially offset by a decline in France. In growth markets, revenue grew 9% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, software and platforms, and industrial. Revenue growth was driven by Argentina and Japan. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.5% compared with 32.4% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% compared with 10.8% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were 6.8% compared to 6.7% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that results in Q4 of FY '24 and FY '23 include costs associated with business optimization actions, which impacted operating margin and EPS. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 15% adjusted operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with Q4 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.2% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 27.4% for the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.79 compared with adjusted EPS of $2.71 in the fourth quarter last year. Days service outstanding were 46 days compared to 43 days last quarter and 42 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $214 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $5 billion compared with $9 billion at August 31 last year. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.1 million shares for $628 million at an average price of $303.07 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $1.28 per share for a total of $808 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on November 15, a 15% increase over last year, and approved $4 billion of additional share repurchase authority. Now I'd like to take a moment to summarize the year. Our fiscal '24 results illustrate the diversity and durability of our business as well as our ability to continue to manage our business with rigor and discipline. We delivered record bookings of $81.2 billion, reflecting 13% growth in U.S. dollars and 14% growth in local currency, with a record 125 quarterly client bookings over $100 million, which positions us well as we begin FY '25. Revenue of $64.9 billion for the year reflects growth of 2% local currency. Before I continue, I want to note that results for the full fiscal year '24 and fiscal '23 include costs associated with business optimization actions, and fiscal '23 results also reflect a gain on investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted operating margin, our tax rate and EPS. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating margin of 15.5%, a 10 basis point expansion over FY '23. Adjusted earnings per share were $11.95, reflecting a 2% growth over adjusted FY '23 EPS. Free cash flow of $8.6 billion reflected a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. And with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we returned $7.8 billion of cash to shareholders while investing approximately $6.6 billion across 46 acquisitions. In closing, we feel good about how we managed our business while navigating a challenging macro environment in FY '24 and we remain committed to delivering on our enduring shareholder value proposition while creating 360 degree value for all our stakeholders. And now back to you, Julie.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you, KC. Our FY '24 growth was driven by our clients seeking to reinvent using tech, data, AI and new ways of working. Reinvention requires a strong digital core. In FY '25, a significant driver of our growth will continue to be helping our clients with digital transformation, including building out their digital core and then using it to drive productivity and growth. We see the advent of GenAI and its tremendous potential acting as a catalyst for reinvention. Our clients turn to us for our unique combination of services across strategy, consulting, song, Industry X, technology and operations. Our strategists and deep industry functional customer and technology consultants work hand-in-hand with our clients and across services to shape and deliver these reinventions. Our investments in our advanced platforms, our assets and solutions, our process expertise, the insights from our scale and diversification, and our ability to both design and build the solutions, combined with our managed services are key differentiators for us. At the same time, we see AI as the new digital. Like digital, AI is both the technology and a new way of working, and the full value will only come from strategies built on both productivity and growth. And it will be used in every part of the enterprise. We believe the introduction of GenAI signifies a transformative era that is set to drive growth for us and our clients over the next decade much like digital technology has in the last decade and continues to do so. As part of that, we expect that the work to prepare enterprise data, which is the fuel for AI will be an increasing part of our growth. To accomplish reinvention and take advantage of AI, businesses need to focus on talent, their ability to access the best people at the right time, place and cost, the ability to be a talent creator to keep their people market relevant and their ability to unlock the potential of their talent is critical. We see talent as a top C-suite agenda item. Today, our managed services are an important part of our clients' long-term talent strategy. Our ability to harness AI is helping them close talent gaps and our strong expertise across talent, change, HR and organizations differentiates all our services. Our launch of LearnVantage, which provides comprehensive technology learning and training services, helps our clients reskill and upskill their people so they can be a talent creator. Let me give you a few examples of the types of reinventions we are doing. In Financial Services, banking and insurance are on their reinvention journey, while retirement services a $15 billion global addressable market growing at about 6% has lagged behind. We have invested to grow our capabilities and talent to capture this next wave of growth. We are working with TIAA, the largest U.S. provider of lifetime income to accelerate the transformation of the company's retirement record-keeping capabilities and operations. Leveraging the power of AI, automation in the cloud, we are helping the company implement new technologies, making record-keeping processes more efficient over time and easier for their customers. Through this strategic partnership, we are supporting parts of TIAA's record-keeping operations, including back end processes and technology. For example, retirement plan sponsors will experience faster plan changes and participants will find it easier to initiate account openings and investment selections. Together, we are making retirement planning more accessible, efficient and personalized for individuals and clients, helping TIAA need its mission of a more secure in retirement for more Americans. Today, we work with 75% of the world's largest communication services providers. With our strong industry and technology expertise, we are modernizing a global Telecom's core IT operations to drive growth. Through our managed services program, we are consolidating IT vendors, increasing productivity by an estimated 60% and reducing cost by half. We are also infusing our GenAI tools to enhance the software development life cycle and automate manual tasks such as resolving technical issues with customer orders, invoices or service availability. Now this will free up employees to focus on strategic growth initiatives and improve the overall customer experience. We are also implementing new ways of working, and then we'll train and upscale the team to use the new GenAI tools more effectively, helping to create more profitable outcomes for the company. These changes will create a stronger management framework and prepare the company for expansion into new markets. Security continues to be one of the fastest growing parts of our business, reaching $9 billion in revenue this year, representing 23% growth. We are partnering with the Kuwait Government Central Agency for information technology to revolutionize the security posture of its public services and national critical infrastructure. We are implementing and managing a scalable platform powered by GenAI, enabling the agency to act on evolving cyber threats up to 60% quicker than with traditional technologies, including detection response and containment models. In the past, security analysts manually research threats with limited information before handing the incident to the impacted government entity losing valuable time as the attack progressed. But now using a new platform, when analysts open a potential incident, they can quickly drill down into details about the users, systems under attack, type of attack and more with just one click. Thanks to GenAI's ability to process significant amounts of data and automatically elaborate context as a threat is detected, we are supporting our experts in making faster decisions with confidence as we progressively onboard over 60 government entities and while we also develop local talent. The strategic collaboration underscores our commitment to safeguarding Kuwait's digital assets and empowering the nation's journey towards enhanced cybersecurity resilience. A key area for companies to seek reinvention is in marketing, where the potential to use tech, data and creativity to drive growth, drive tangible outcomes for the enterprise. We are very proud to be working with HP and American multinational information technology company and a new global partnership to develop the right data sets, technology and creative for their B2B powerhouse business and brand that fulfils their goal to move away from the traditional agency model to true marketing capability transformation to significantly improve the impact, efficacy and efficiency of their marketing investment with the ability to drive tangible business results. In every industry, there is a challenge or opportunity that GenAI can now uniquely solve. Our deep understanding of both the industry and the technology positions us to be the best at creating real value from GenAI with our clients. For example, in insurance, companies can't typically process 100% of their coverage submissions. This creates a bottleneck for revenue growth. The ability to leverage GenAI to read 100% of submissions allows insurance companies to better assess risk as well as quote and write more policies and do it all more quickly and cost effectively. Utilizing a new set of solutions we created, we're working with QBE Insurance Group, a multinational insurance company headquartered in Sydney, to scale industry-leading AI powered underwriting solutions, replicated across multiple lines of business to help the company to make faster and more accurate business decisions. A series of Board, executive level and all employee learning sessions were conducted to help drive the design and build those solutions that analyze new business submissions for completeness, appetite check and risk evaluation insights. They can now process 100% of submissions received from brokers, greatly accelerating market response time. After nine months in market, these solutions are winning multiple industry innovation awards and early results indicate an increase in both quote to buying rate and premium. This collaboration will enable QBE Insurance Group to identify and select risk more effectively, improve broker and customer experience and support growth. We are collaborating with a major integrated downstream energy provider to drive significant improvements in safety, sustainability and operational performance with three new GenAI powered solutions. We aim to continue to improve safety by using proactive insights from GenAI to inform planners of potential incidents instead of reactively waiting for specific warning signs to appear. This means 90% faster data access, reducing planning time from hours to minutes per task. Another solution will help detect methane leaks in real time and prioritize their resolutions. We also helped build a smart solution for operators and process engineers to drive custom insights to optimize refinery performance and reduce downtime. The energy provider is on a path to set a new industry standard for innovation and refinery operations. One of the most powerful impactful uses of GenAI today across industry is in consumer experience transformation. We are working with Mondelez International, a world leader in snacking with well-known brands like Oreo, belVita and Cadbury to transform their marketing organization with GenAI to help drive consumer behavior. As part of this program, we're standing up a refreshed operating model with a primary focus on upskilling their employees in GenAI technologies. We are also helping enable a new capability to scale content creation and generate personalized text, images and videos across markets. This means exceptional creative can be developed in hours, not weeks, allowing content to be catered to consumers quickly as demands change. The strong digital core we established also allows the company to collect and process real-time data using GenAI to create new contextualized insights that can be easily accessed, shared and used by decision makers across the company. This work will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of messaging to create more impactful experiences. Now let's turn to our acquisitions. Over the last decade, we have built a finely tuned acquisition capability, becoming known in the market as a good home with approximately 70% on average of our acquisitions sole sourced. While our ability to identify and evaluate our acquisitions is critical, it is our ability to integrate them successfully that has made our acquisition capabilities so formidable. As we look forward, we are excited about the opportunity to better serve our clients and differentiate in the market to the acquisitions we've made this last fiscal year. As a reminder, we do acquisitions ultimately to drive our organic growth. Our global footprint, deep client relationships across industries as well as strong ecosystem gives us a unique perspective on growth opportunities. We use acquisitions to scale quickly in growth areas, to build new skills in adjacent markets and to deepen our technology, industry and functional expertise. Over the years, acquisitions have built major areas of growth like what we call Song today in our security practice. Here are a few examples of where we are investing now to lead in the next waves of growth. Starting with capital projects, an over $440 billion addressable global market growing approximately 5%. In FY '22, globally, we had approximately $300 million in capital projects revenue. We entered the U.S. market in FY '23 with the acquisition of Anser Advisory. Since the beginning of FY '24, we expanded our reach into Canada with Comtech in Q1, and this Q4, we acquired BOSLAN in EMEA. We recognized over $800 million in revenue on capital projects this fiscal year '24. Health is an industry still early in digitization, where we see significant opportunity over the next decade. It is a $70 billion addressable global market growing approximately 6%. This year, we added Cognosante in the U.S., creating a new federal health portfolio in our federal service business. We also acquired Nautilus Consulting in the U.K., a digital consultancy specializing in electronic patient records. And we announced our intent to acquire consus.health, a health care consultancy in Germany that offer services ranging from medical strategy and patient management to procurement and logistics, infrastructure management and construction planning services. And in Europe, public service, an industry that is early in digitization with significant investment allocated for transformation, our acquisitions are accelerating our growth and setting us up to take shares in a $46 billion market that is growing approximately 5%. We acquired Arns, Aris (ph) in Germany, a technology services provider supporting the public sector transformation across Europe. In Italy, we acquired Intellera Consulting, one of Italy's main professional services providers operating the public administration and health care sectors, and Customer Management IT and SirfinPA, jointly owned consultancies, supporting the public sector and specializing in justice and public safety. Now it gives me great pleasure to hand over to Angie Park, who'll become our new CFO on December 1, who will take us through our guidance for FY '25. Angie?\nAngie Park: Thanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal '25, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.85 billion to $17.45 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately positive 1.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '24 and reflects an estimated 2% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal '25, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately positive 1.5% compared to fiscal '24. For the full fiscal '25, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 3% to 6% growth in local currency over fiscal '24, which includes an inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3%. And we expect to invest about $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For operating margin, we expect fiscal year '25 to be 15.6% to 15.8%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '24 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal '24. We expect our full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal '25 to be in the range of $12.55 to $12.91, or 5% to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal '24 results. For the full fiscal '25, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.4 billion to $10.1 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. We expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders. Finally, as part of our routine review of our capital structure, we expect to tap the long-term debt market in the near term to increase our liquidity for general corporate purposes as we look to optimize our capital structure and reduce our cost of capital. We expect to raise a modest amount of debt. In connection with that, there would be no change to our capital allocation strategy, which includes how we look at and use D&A (ph) or our strong credit ratings and our net leverage will remain low. We have incorporated the potential for long-term debt into our guidance, including the interest expense. With that, let's open it up, so that we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks, Angie. We will now take your question. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow up to allow as many participants to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thank you so much. Yeah, really strong bookings. I wanted to think about how that translates into revenue visibility. If you don't mind, I know Accenture doesn't normally talk about ACV, but can you maybe comment on the current relationship between ACV and TCV and how that's evolving? It seems really important to us as we think about revenue and visibility. Duration looks like it's up, but you also have a lot of large deals converting as well, so can you comment on that?\nAngie Park: Hi, Tien-Tsin. Good morning. It's Angie. So let me cover guidance because maybe it will help to paint a picture of how we're thinking about the full fiscal year. I think it's really important. Let's start with how we ended Q4. If you think about the 5% growth that we posted in the fourth quarter, what we highlighted was that we did have slight growth in organic, which is important as we exit the year. And as you just talked about, over the last few quarters, we've really pivoted our business to what our clients are buying, which are the large transformation deals. And what that does is it positions us better than compared to the same time last year on the revenue that we've already sold. From an inorganic contribution, I do want to highlight that overall, we expect a bit over 3% for the year, which would imply with our guidance of 3% to 6%, that at the bottom end of the range, organic is flat. And then at the top end of the range, we're growing 3% in organic growth. And then as you peel it back and you look at the revenue growth that we see, it is broad based, and we saw that coming out of Q4, we see it across the market and across all of our industry groups. And then as -- when you look at it by type of work as well, what we see right now is that both consulting and managed services, we see low to mid-single digit growth rates for the year. And so stepping back with the color and how we're looking at our guidance, we're very pleased with how we have set ourselves up that and positioned ourselves for fiscal '25.\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. And so Tien-Tsin, what that means is, we're not commenting specifically on ACV and TCV because as you said that isn't. But the way to think about the confidence level and going to the year, right, is that we told you that we had a strategy to have more megas. We've shared with you that we had 19 more of these bookings than last year, $100 million or more. So you can see there's a big quantum. And so as you think about going into the year, we've got a bigger base of revenue coming from these larger deals coming online than we did going into fiscal year '24. And so that's really how we're trying to help you all think about it is by being clear about that strategy and how -- and the quantum of that, and that's how we then think about the year. So hopefully, that gives you some more insights together with the view on the guidance.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, it does and it's very reasonable as well, just to say that loud out. Just on the acquisition side, Julie, I think I asked it last quarter, so I'll ask again. I know you've been very busy. I like the examples that you gave around the productivity you're getting from some of the deals and the examples you gave again. But how about just overall appetite this year, are you still seeing good opportunities? Could we see a stepdown or a pause in the short term, anything else to add?\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. So what I would say is, as Angie just said, our inorganic plan for the year, like, in terms of -- as you think about revenue guidance, we kind of -- we're going into the year with nearly 3%, and we think we'll -- right now, the plan for is a little bit above 3% is what we're seeing for fiscal year '25. And that reflects an expected plan right now of about $3 billion of deployed capital. So a step down from last year and probably more backend loaded as we look at our pipeline. Now obviously, we always have the ability to flex up or down. We only tie it to the opportunities in the market, but that’s how we’re seeing this year as we think about our investments.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Perfect. Thank you. Well done. Thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thanks for taking our question, guys. This is Antonio (ph) on for James. I wanted to actually dig into the technology segment. I know cloud is a big component of this. Could you talk through how clients spend on these cloud migration projects has been trending over the last 90 days and how we should think about cloud growth going into fiscal year '25? And then I have a follow-up after.\nJulie Sweet: Hi, Antonio. I'm not going to think about it in the last 90 days is just think about like sort of where we've been and where we think we're going, right?\nUnidentified Participant: Yeah.\nJulie Sweet: So, in cloud, you still have a lot of migration that's happening, but on more of the high-performance compute applications. So things like mainframe, right? So -- and you also still have some clients who are very, very early in their cloud journey. And one of the things I talked about in the script, for example, was like retirement services. Like that's an entire segment where they're very, very early in the cloud journey. And so at the same time, you've got companies that are very early, just starting their cloud journey. You have those who are farther along who are now getting to the harder applications like mainframe. And then we still have a lot of modernization because what happened in the pandemic, people who were trying to get to the cloud to get the infrastructure savings, have not yet done the modernization. And that modernization, of course, feeds into all the things we do, right, brings the industry and the functional expertise. And so as we look going into FY '25, we continue to see those strengths. So we expect that cloud is going to continue to be a significant driver of growth but on all of those dimensions, right? And the high performance compute as well requires very deep industry knowledge, like doing mainframe in the context of health is very different than the context of banking. So hopefully, that helps you.\nUnidentified Participant: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then, I wanted to ask on the organic headcount. It actually looks like that ticked up quite a bit. Could you comment on your hiring strategy and in what geographies you're sort of looking to shape that?\nAngie Park: Yeah. Why don't I start and then Julie add (ph) any additional comments as well. So as you can see, I mean, I want to start with how we're exiting the year. We saw slight organic growth in Q4, and we see that momentum into FY '25. You will have also seen that we added about 24,000 people this year in Q4, which is reflective of the momentum that we see in the business. And as always, right, looking ahead, we will always hire for the skills and the demand that we see. And just more broadly, I would just remind us that as you think about us, as a business, our core competency is balancing supply -- managing supply and demand. And you see that through our utilization rates, which continue to be in the 92% range.\nJulie Sweet: And we're hiring -- from a talent strategy, right, we are hiring primarily in India. So a lot of that hiring is technology in India and, of course, also addresses -- we are refreshing our pyramid at this time. So you've got kind of the new college graduates coming in. So there's really no change in our talent strategy. We hire all over the world. And in technology, which is a big driver of the growth that we're seeing now and going into FY '25, that is a lot of hiring in India.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Thanks. I wanted to pick up on the commentary about the consulting outlook for fiscal '25. You said up low to mid-single digits. I think that's very consistent with the exit rate of 3% coming out of fiscal '24. So does that imply that you are not building much of a discretionary spending recovery into this initial F '25 guide?\nAngie Park: Yeah. Hi, Jason. Good morning. How are you? And let me just give you a little bit of color on that as you think about the types of work and the question that you just asked. If you think about our range overall, so we're at 3% to 6% for the full year. And what this assumes is, at the top end, we see more of the thing, right, in terms of the discretionary spending environment. While at the bottom end, it allows for further deterioration in the discretionary spend environment over what we experienced in FY '24.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe one for Julie. I just wanted to get your broad take on the macro backdrop. I mean, I guess, what are decision makers telling you right now versus three months ago? What are they waiting to see to open the discretionary budget a little bit more?\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. Well, the environment is really more of the same and that environment has been kind of a cautious environment. Right now, they're going into budget season. So as always, we'll really see in January and on February, but there hasn't been much of a change, right? The macro is kind of the same. Obviously, there's some events going to come up in the fall that people are thinking about, but there's not like a big tone change, right? And I think, because if you look at the macroeconomic environment, FY '25 is going to click down in the U.S., maybe a little bit better in Europe. But overall, not a lot of improvement. So we're not hearing -- I'm not hearing from CEOs, and I'm talking to them almost every day, some big like, hey, now we're ready to go spend more, right, in discretionary spending. So it's really just more of the same. And by the way, one of the changes that we made this last fiscal year '24 was normally we do for decades, our big promotion period was in December, and then a small one in June. And so in fiscal year '24, we switched these, right? We said we have a lot more visibility in our business in January or February because that's where budgets are set. So we did that this past year and had a really big promotion, a very nice promotion, I would say, not really big, but very nice promotion in this past June. We've now permanently shifted that promotion cycle. So we will do our big promotion cycle in June and our smaller one in December to better match when our clients are setting their budgets and we have better visibility. And that's what we're seeing again. The justification for that is clear that we're really no IT spending and spending on our services in the budgets in January, February.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks for all the color.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much. I wanted to revisit on M&A, if I could, and just get some clarification. In FY '24, you spent, as you noted $6.6 billion, which was up about 160% year-over-year. And if we sort of do the math on what your normalized multiples are to revenue, it looks like you're starting the year of FY '25 with 3 points of M&A help. And so I just want to understand, is that the right way to think about it? And then Julie, you had indicated that you plan to spend $3 billion more in M&A this year, and it will be, as you said, backend weighted. But I'm just struggling why M&A is that $3 billion number is even second half weighted, why M&A isn't 4% or more for the year?\nAngie Park: Let me just start with peeling back our inorganic contribution a bit. As we look at the deals that we closed in '24, it's nearly 3% contribution, right? And so with the backend loaded approach in our capital deployed, we do see a bit over 3%, and that's just the math.\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. It's just timing, right? It's not quite 3% going in because a lot of this closed at the end of Q4, right? And so it's just its timing, right? And it's the way we see our pipeline developing, right? Because we have a view of what we're going to -- we think we're going to spend in Q1 and Q2 and how that rolls in.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Let me transition the bookings then. As you think about FY ‘25, and I know you don't guide to bookings, it's more of an output, but any puts and takes that you want us to think about in terms of the book-to-bill ratio in FY '25 that might be higher or lower? Any kind of cadence there? And if you don't mind, was there an M&A help in the August quarter bookings as well or signings, excuse me?\nAngie Park: Why don't I start, in terms of the way to think about our bookings, we were super pleased with the $81 billion of bookings that we had for the year, which was 14% growth, which included the 125 quarterly client bookings over $100 million. And so I think that, that we were super pleased with. And you saw that in our book-to-bill and our growth rate in managed services was driven by our large transformation deals. For us, over time of our four trailing quarters, we're always looking for our consulting book-to-bill to be 1.0 or better and for our managed services to be 1.2 or better and nothing has changed there.\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. And there was nothing in M&A about our bookings in Q4.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Many thanks.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Good morning. Julie, I just want to ask about GenAI. I think bookings were up almost about $300 million in the third quarter sequentially, up about $100 million this quarter. Anything about the cadence there of GenAI and fall through there that you can help us understand?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. So yeah, so we ended with $3 billion bookings for the year, and we'd expect in FY '25, another healthy increase. We know there's clear demand. We're starting to see more of our clients move from proof-of-concept to sort of larger implementations, which is important. So the size of those bookings is kind of, is clicking up. And also, we're continuing to see kind of at least every other one has got data pull-through and even that's kind of moving up. So we're kind of going into the year, we'd see -- we'd expect another healthy increase in our bookings and our revenue from that and also that data will continue to kind of be a bigger and bigger part of that building out of the digital core because one of the biggest limitations on using GenAI today and why it's going to take a while is our client needs data and our clients have a lot of work to do on data, which is, of course, a big opportunity for us.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And then just a clarification on the guide. I know the fourth quarter organic growth was positive, and we're talking about fiscal year '25 revenue guide of 3% to 6% on a constant currency basis. And if you back out the acquisitions, I think you guys said on the low end, we're talking about flat organic growth, that would be a slight step down from the fourth quarter, which is -- would be a little surprising given some of the momentum that you guys are seeing in bookings and in headcount growth. So just wanted to make sure I understood what that low end might imply and why would there necessarily be a step down from where the fourth quarter kind of ended? Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Yeah. No. And the way we're thinking about it, right, we're going into the year with momentum. We had executed on the strategy around the bigger deals. So we have a stronger base of revenue. We've got the acquisitions. And so on the bottom end of the range, what we would see, like the most likely reason to be there is if there was a deterioration in the discretionary spend environment, right? So we're trying to just kind of give some flexibility. We’re not seeing that, right? We sell more of the same this quarter. And so as we kind of go into the year, at the top end of the range, it’s the current environment going forward. And at the bottom of the range, if you were to ask me today, what is that mostly accommodated is if there was a deterioration in spending, right, so -- because of kind of the way we’ve positioned ourselves.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Great results and great guidance here. Two questions on GenAI. Are you seeing more of your conversations being less replacement and reallocation and purely incremental on G&A? And then I have a follow-up.\nJulie Sweet: Well, I think it starts with, we're not seeing a change in what our clients are spending on IT, right? So -- but what we are seeing is the continued trend of trying to save money on IT to free up the spending on areas of GenAI. So on the one hand, right now, we haven't seen a change in overall spending. We'll see what the budgets come in January, February, but we're not expecting a big change. But what we also are seeing is that as they're saving money, they want to invest it in things like GenAI and data. So that's really the dynamic that's going on, save to invest, but we haven't seen signs of overall change.\nDan Dolev: Got it. And then a quick follow-up on margins. Can you maybe touch on the GenAI services margin, how it stands versus your traditional business? I think that would be really helpful for investors. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Are you -- I mean, are GenAI margin and sort of -- is that different from when we're doing GenAI versus other GenAI technology?\nDan Dolev: Correct. GenAI services versus your traditional consulting business.\nJulie Sweet: Look, GenAI is still a small part of our business, and I wouldn't really think about it as having a particularly different margin profile at this time. And as you probably heard in our -- in my script that a lot of time we're starting to embed GenAI in our larger deals and so we're not really thinking about it as like a sort of a separate way. So I wouldn't think about it too differently than our usual business.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Thanks. Well, great momentum. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJim Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Very helpful commentary on the client outlook on limited discretionary spend. But can you maybe help us understand or unpack, when you talk to them, what are they looking for to release discretionary spend? Is it more macro factors, whether that be rates, election or regulatory or is it more micro factors tied to their IT budgets? And if it's the latter, what are the things they're looking for in terms of getting increased clarity on those priorities going into 2025?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. It's a good question. And it's really -- overall, there is a sense of the macro, right? Because if you look at the -- a lot of our clients are global. If you look at the macroeconomic, there isn't a big change. There's kind of going into next year, like the U.S., which is a big market, it looks like it's going to be down a little bit. Europe's up a little bit, but still not great. And so kind of if you start with they're not seeing a big change in the macro. But then you really have to look at it industry by industry because each industry has factors. So for example, in the energy industries, they're super focused on how much investment they have to do and the change – and the shift in climate change and renewables. So there's a big appetite for major investment. So there's no catalyst that says, oh, like I've got a ton of thought. They've got a lot of big investments, right? If you look at consumer goods, where a lot of the consumer goods companies are not able to get pricing. They've got to get up volume, which means they've got to drive down their -- they've got to improve their efficiency and their manufacturing costs, and that takes big investments because manufacturing. Our latest research says like two-thirds of the journey in digitization is still to come. And so those are big investments. And so I can kind of take you through industry by industry. The reality is, it's obviously good growth for us is the digitization journey is still very early in many, many industries, that's like public service is another great example. So they've got big transformations going. And at the end of the day, if you're a big enterprise, like, the deals that are smaller, right, they do not move the needle. And when you've got big investments, that's where they're focused because they see now the potential of things like GenAI, and everyone's like we got to get going, that's really what's driving it. So that's why we're not having a bunch of discussions about like I can't wait to unlock that spending. Our discussions are entirely on help us move faster with our bigger information. That's really what we're focused on.\nJim Schneider: That's very helpful. Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-on, you referenced several verticals there. Can you maybe, as you prospectively look into fiscal '25, call out maybe one or two verticals where you expect the most improvement and maybe one or two where you see potential risk of deterioration? Thank you.\nAngie Park: Yeah. Hey, Jim. Nice to talk to you. I think that as we look across FY '25 in our overall guide of 3% to 6%. We see broad-based growth across -- it's really broad-based across all of our industries as well as our services and markets.\nJim Schneider: Great. Thank you.\nKatie O’Conor: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then we’ll wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will come from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. On GenAI, can you give us a sense of the size of some of the largest individual programs have reached? And then as it relates to internal productivity progress, may be comment on any of the service lines where you're seeing the earliest impacts as it relates to productivity or any metrics that you can share in more advance programs?\nJulie Sweet: Sure. I don't want to start like giving tons of data on this. But like you went from deals that were -- in GenAI that were, on average, kind of sub-$1 million, right, that you've now got some that are above $10 million, right? So that's still the smaller end because you're sort of moving into production and scale. But you're starting to see these things move from POCs to larger bookings. And then with respect to internal productivity and our guidance, of course, takes into account what we're seeing. As I've been talking about is that the first area that we anticipate -- remember, we're trying to embrace GenAI fastest because we think it's a big differentiator with our clients. And so in our managed services is where we're seeing the most because that's where we have a platform. So you all remember we used to talk about myWizard. Now we talk about GenWizard, right? But what we're seeing is that the technology and the productivity is like similar ways before. So if you go back to 2015, 2016, when we first introduced myWizard, right? So it's not really different than the kinds of productivity that we've been experiencing. And here, of course, there's an added wrinkle in that GenAI, in order for us to use it with our clients, they have to allow us to use it and they have to prioritize. And they have a lot of other areas where they want to use GenAI that's not necessarily in their technology productivity where they're already many of our clients are using our platforms, they're using AI, etc. So there's a lot of factors that kind of go into the pace of how quickly we can use it even if we're ready to use it now in many places. So hopefully, that's helpful because it is a little bit different in that sense because our clients have to prioritize where they want to use GenAI, too.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I appreciate your commentary on the capital returns on the balance sheet and understanding this has overall been a tougher environment, while M&A outlay has been on the upper end. But just curious how we should be thinking about the potential magnitude of leverage in the model going forward? Just any guardrails we should consider?\nAngie Park: Yeah. And a couple of things that I would say around that. We indicated that it's going to be modest. We'll maintain our strong credit ratings and net leverage will be low. And so -- and included in our guidance that we provided you, we have also allowed for the potential for the interest expense and in our overall guidance, which is in addition to the variability that we may see in operating margin throughout the year.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nJulie Sweet: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. Before I wrap up, I want to thank KC, who's been an amazing partner and friend these last five years. They've been quite some five years, as we all know, just a few things in the environment that we've gotten together work with. And so I'm really excited for KC and her next chapter. And KC, would you like to say a few words?\nKatie O'Conor: I would, thanks, Julie. I just want to offer my sincere thanks to the investor and analyst community for the decade plus of console and support. It's really meant a lot to me. It's really been appreciated. Thanks a lot, and best wishes to all of you.\nJulie Sweet: So I want to thank everyone for joining us and thank all of our people for what you do every day, allowing us to create 360 degree value and giving us a lot of confidence in our success in FY ‘25. And thanks again, KC, and welcome Angie to your new role, and we’ll see you all in the next quarter.\nAngie Park: Thank you.\nOperator: This conference will be available for replay beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today and running through mid-night on December 18.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatie O'Conor : Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2025 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. Angie will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Julie will then provide an update on our market positioning before Angie provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2025. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now let me turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sweet : Thank you, Katie, and everyone joining. And thank you to our nearly 799,000 people around the world for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in a strong quarter of financial results, creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. I am very pleased with our performance this quarter, as we delivered on our strategy to position Accenture for strong growth and fiscal year 2025. Here are a few highlights of the 360-degree value we created. Our clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, and we are their reinvention partner of choice, as reflected in our bookings of $18.7 billion, including 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than a $100 million. We grew 8% in local currency this quarter with revenue of $17.7 billion approximately $240 million above the top end of our guided range and continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share. We had another milestone quarter in GenAI with $1.2 billion in bookings and approximately $500 million in revenue. Operating margin was flat compared to adjusted operating margin last year. EPS grew 10% over Q1 adjusted FY24 EPS. While we continue to invest in our business and our people with $242 million deployed primarily across five acquisitions and with approximately 14 million training hours this quarter designed to help us bring the latest in solutions and technology to our clients, provide our people with marketable skills, and reinvent our services using GenAI. This averages 19 hours per person. We increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 69,000, continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of fiscal year 2026. We are proud to be recognized by Fortune as one of the world's best workplaces, jumping from #10 to #6. This recognition is important, as it is based on feedback from our people around the world. An essential part of our strategy is having access to the best people and being an attractive workplace is critical to our success. And in recognition of our strong brand, we are proud to earn our highest brand value to date on Interbrand's Prestigious Best Global Brands List, increasing to $21.9 billion and ranking #31. We continue to invest in creating and maintaining thriving communities, which our long-term growth depends on. This quarter, among other things, Accenture has partnered with the NGO Instituto PROA in Brazil to help transform the lives of low-income youth by providing them with digital skills to enter the workforce. I am very pleased with our results this quarter and our return to broad-based growth due to our strategy to be our client reinvention partner of choice. We also have a resilient business model with diversity across markets, industries, and the types of work our clients come to us for, both consulting type of work and managed services. Over to you, Angie.\nAngie Park : Thank you, Julie, and happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and reflects momentum across our business. We are particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth, which was broad-based across geographic markets, industry groups, and consulting and managed services, demonstrating we are a leader in the market as a trusted reinvention partner for our clients. Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year revenue outlook, which I will cover more detail later in our call. So, let me begin by summarizing a few highlights in the quarter. Revenues grew 8% in local currency above the top end of our guided range with six of our 13 industries growing double digits, and we continue to take market share. We delivered EPS in the quarter of $3.59, reflecting 10% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Operating margin was 16.7% for the quarter, consistent with adjusted Q1 results last year and includes significant investments in our people in our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $870 million and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $242 million primarily attributed to five acquisitions in the quarter. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details starting with new bookings. New bookings were $18.7 billion for the quarter representing 1% growth in both U.S. Dollars and local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $9.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Managed services bookings were $9.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Turning now to revenue. Revenues for the quarter were $17.7 billion, a 9% increase in U.S. Dollars and 8% in local currency, approximately $240 million above the top end of our guided range. The foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately positive 1% compared with the positive 1.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9 billion, up 7% in U.S. Dollars and 6% in local currency. Managed services revenue were $8.6 billion, up 11% in both U.S. Dollars and local currency, driven by double-digit growth in technology-managed services, which includes our application-managed services and infrastructure-managed services, and high single-digit growth in operations. Turning to our geographic markets, in the Americas, revenues grew 11% in local currency. Growth was led by industrial, software and platforms, banking and capital markets, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services. Revenue growth was driven by the United States and Argentina. In EMEA, revenues grew 6% in local currency, led by growth in public service, life sciences, and health, partially offset by a decline in banking and capital markets. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Italy, partially offset by a decline in France. In Asia Pacific, we delivered 4% revenue growth in local currency driven by growth in utilities, industrial, and health, partially offset by a decline in chemicals and natural resources. Revenue growth was led by Japan, which represents approximately half of Asia Pacific, partially offset by declines in Singapore and Australia. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared to 33.6% for the first quarter last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.2% compared with 10.5% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q1 of last year, we recorded $140 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 90 basis points in EPS by $0.17. Following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Operating income was $2.9 billion in the first quarter reflecting a 16.7% operating margin consistent with adjusted operating margin in Q1 of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.2% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.59 compared with adjusted EPS of $3.27 in the first quarter last year reflecting 10% growth over adjusted EPS in Q1 last year. Day services outstanding were 50 days compared to 46 days last quarter and 49 days in the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $870 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $152 million. Following the completion of our $5 billion inaugural debt offering, our cash balance at November 30th was $8.3 billion compared with $5 billion at August 31st. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.5 million shares for $898 million at an average price of $355.03 per share. As of November 30th, we had approximately $5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $926 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year and our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 for share to be paid on February 14th, a 15% increase over last year. So in summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we are off to a strong start in FY25. And now, let me turn it back to Julie.\nJulie Sweet : Thank you, Angie. Starting with the demand environment, we saw more of the same. Our clients are focused on reinvention, which means large-scale transformations. We do not currently see an improvement in overall spending by our clients, particularly on smaller deals. When those market conditions improve, we will be well-positioned to capitalize on them, as we continue to meet the demand for the critical programs our clients are prioritizing. As expected, building the strong digital core required for reinvention was a strong driver of our growth this quarter. GenAI continues to be a catalyst for reinvention across the enterprise and building out the data foundation necessary to capitalize on AI, as an increasing part of that growth. Themes around achieving both cost efficiencies and growth continue across the demand we're seeing. Through the examples from Q1, you can see both our strategy to be the reinvention partner of choice and how we are bringing together our services, our ecosystem relationships, and our scaled investments in cutting-edge platforms like SynOps and GenWizard, as well as technologies like GenAI to drive value for our clients. We are helping our clients build their digital core, including in the cloud, which saw double-digit growth this quarter. Accenture Federal Services is working with the U.S. Air Force, the nation's military service air branch, on a cloud monetization journey to manage its complex IT environment so that military personnel can maintain their competitive edge. We will develop a multi-cloud ecosystem using services from multiple providers to create a robust, secure, and integrated infrastructure. This will enhance how different systems and devices work together and communicate to quickly implement cutting-edge tools and technologies. We also provide managed services that foster collaboration and enable personnel to quickly make data-driven decisions about their cloud usage and costs while adapting to changing mission requirements. This partnership will enable the U.S. Air Force to get the most out of their cloud investments to achieve real-time cross-cost transparency, accelerated cost savings, increased efficiency, and improved agility. Our industry expertise is critical to building the right digital core. We are partnering with the BCC ICCREA Group, Italy's largest cooperative banking group, through a joint venture with its IT subsidiary on a reinvention journey to help over 100 affiliated banks grow. Our managed services will modernize the IT platform and migrate applications to the cloud, enhancing resiliency, stability, and service quality. We will also consolidate data and build an integrated cloud platform for advanced analytics and AI, strengthening their digital core. GenAI will be applied to increase internal IT efficiency and reduce customer response time on digital interaction channels. We will expand digital offerings, employee onboarding, and payments using our suite of shared finance services solutions. A change management communications program will offer targeted up-skilling and re-skilling opportunities to ensure employees use new technologies and methodologies effectively. Together we will help BCC, ICCREA Group, reduce costs and drive innovation, enabling the banking group to be more competitive and bring new products and services to market faster. Security is an absolutely essential component of every company's digital core, and we again saw very strong double-digit growth. We are the partner-of-choice in part because we bring both the understanding of cross industry threats and industry specific threats with our deep experience across 13 industry groups. We are supporting a leading aircraft manufacturer and its cybersecurity across aerospace and defense on critical infrastructure and production systems. We will provide managed services and solutions for their cyber security capability, leading to a more powerful and secure program, bringing security by design and industrial assets and the extended enterprise. Our solutions will help provide improved security and meet regulatory compliance. We are also helping with the digitization of manufacturing and supply chains. Industry X grew double digits this quarter. We are continuing to evolve our long-time partnership with a global leader [in tire] (ph) manufacturing to revolutionize the way factories operate and to reduce time-to-market for new products, accelerating innovation. We will build a hybrid data foundation in the cloud, integrating millions of data points. We will also implement advanced analytics, AI, and digital twin technologies to optimize operations processes such as quality checks. This will enable the company to trace the root cause of a failed batch of tires back to a machine or process in minutes instead of days. And predictive maintenance will pinpoint what parts of their process or machinery may be impacting quality and productivity, preventing costly down times. Engineering teams will benefit from machine learning and simulation tools to generate and optimize the design of new products. We will also implement new ways of working to attract tech-savvy talent and cultivate a learning culture where employees in over 100 factories are upskilled on the AI powered tools. The company will look to increase growth opportunities and support their digital first strategy, all while remaining competitive in the market. We are partnering with PUMA India, a leader in sports lifestyle products, to reinvent their supply chain and distribution network. This will meet the ever-evolving customer demand for order delivery in a highly competitive, omni-channel market where quick commerce is becoming the norm. We will use data and AI to identify and set up localized fulfillment centers, optimizing their size and location based on customer sales. Digital twins of these facilities will simulate various process designs and physical automation scenarios to identify bottlenecks. This will help redefine warehouse layouts and improve material flow for more efficient order and return processing, delivering orders up to 70% faster with express delivery for online orders expected to double. Supply chain costs are also expected to decrease by up to 10%, and additional features like solar power and EV charging stations at fulfillment centers will further reduce costs and support sustainability goals. PUMA India will be the first amongst sports brands in the region to build this type of cutting-edge operating model, enhancing customer loyalty to drive future growth. We are reinventing all things customer through Song, which grew high single digits this quarter. We have the ability to integrate creative, data and AI, tech and strategy while leveraging our industry and operations expertise to unlike marketing as a growth enabler for our clients while delivering efficiencies. We are helping Spotify optimize its advertising business by finding opportunities to drive efficiency as it scales globally. Our marketing operations managed services support their ad operations under a single roof, touching a significant amount of their ad revenue across 150 markets.

Accenture's AI refinery platform will provide scaled AI capabilities with pre-built solutions that have a modular architecture to meet clients' needs wherever they are in their AI journey, significantly reducing time to value. This partnership will help Indonesian companies to drive reinvention by harnessing the power of scaled GenAI, propelling innovation, operational efficiency, and sustainable growth in a competitive market. Talent continues to be at the top of the agenda for CEOs and governments, and our LearnVantage services position us to be able to help clients invest in their workforce. Our partnership with S&P Global, a leading provider of financial data analytics and ratings, is driving GenAI innovation across the financial services industry, empowering their workforce to adopt GenAI at scale to enhance productivity and deliver revenue growth. They are equipping nearly 40,000 of their employees with the necessary skills, leveraging Accenture LearnVantage Services, a comprehensive GenAI learning program. This program includes curate and customized content to drive AI fluency and address the industry's evolving talent requirements. Finally, a quick look at how we're continually using our investments and acquisitions to drive our future growth. To continue to scale LearnVantage, we acquired award solutions in the U.S., which expands our learning offerings tailored to the unique needs of the network leaders, network operations and performance engineers, and IT professionals in the telecom space. To enable us to scale [faster in health] (ph), a $70 billion adjustable market growing approximately 6%. We acquired consus.health, a leading German healthcare management consultancy. Health is an industry still early in digitalization, and our investments are positioning us for the continued growth we see over the next several years. And supply chain continues to be in early in digitalization, and we are investing to continue to drive growth. This quarter, we acquired Camelot, an international SAP-focused management and technology consulting firm from Germany with specific strengths in supply chain, data and analytics and Joshua Tree Group in the U.S., supply chain consulting firm specializing in distribution center performance. Back to you, Angie.\nAngie Park : Thanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.2 billion to $16.8 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 2.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and reflects an estimated 5% to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2025, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. Dollars will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2024. For the full fiscal 2025, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 4% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal 2024, which includes an inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3%, which we expect will be about 4% in the first half and about 2% in the second half. And we continue to expect to invest about $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year 2025 to be 15.6% to 15.8% at 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted Fiscal 2024 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2024. We now expect our full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of $12.43 to $12.79 or 4% to 7% growth over adjusted fiscal 2024 results, reflecting the raise in our revenue outlook and adjusting for the revised FX assumption. For the full fiscal '25, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.4 billion to $10.1 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.5 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open to -- so that we can take your questions. Katie?\nKatie O'Conor: Thanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you good morning. It's really encouraging to see the revenue come in here above the guidance range. I think it's the widest margin in nearly two years. Julie, you said that the demand environment is more or less the same. So I'm curious what you [attribute] (ph) this new pattern to and if market conditions are maybe improving underneath here. Any comments?\nJulie Sweet: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. This is the strategy that we've been outlining for the last few quarters, where last year, when we saw the -- spending, particularly on the smaller deals, we pivoted to really focusing on getting -- winning more reinvention partners of choice, so increasing the number of our deals that were over $100 million in a quarter. You'll remember last year, we actually had [125] (ph) of those. And the idea was to increase -- go after the demand, which is in the larger reinventions and that, that would position us to get back to a strong growth in '25 as those deals begin to layer in. And so what you're seeing is the result of -- what we're really proud of was quite a bit of agility last year that when the market changed, we changed, because as you know, these are not easy deals to do quickly. And we quickly pivoted last year, went after the demand and then put ourselves in this position. And that's why we did underscore that the market environment has not changed. This is the result of the strategy we executed, which we're uniquely able to do because we have all the skills and capabilities, we have the mix of consulting and managed services. And so this is what we were talking about last quarter when we said we are going to get back to strong growth based on execution of this strategy. And of course, these are super critical strategic programs. And so when spending does come back and the market does improve, we're at the heart of our clients' business, and we should be well capitalized to pick up on not spending.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. No, the last point is important, short-term stuff comes back. Hope you should see that pretty quickly as well on top of this. So good, thanks. And my follow up, just have to ask it, I get a lot of questions on the U.S. federal government and Accenture's exposure there. I think it's about 8% of revenue based on some of your annual report disclosures. So just curious, given some of the change in administration and the discussion around efficiency, have your expectations? Or are you going to change your strategy here on the U.S. federal government side? Any comments there would be terrific. Thanks for the time.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. Well, we're really excited because our core competencies in federal, right, are around driving efficiencies. They're around helping -- keep our country secure. We're working with the U.S. federal agency on securing critical infrastructure, right, and on changing citizen services. We work across very important agencies. And so we believe that we're super well positioned to continue to help the mission of the federal government to secure itself, to help citizens and to drive more efficiencies, which will be tied very much to cloud, data and AI. And what really makes us uniquely positioned is that we believe that there is going to be an even greater appetite of taking commercial solutions to the federal government. And we are very uniquely positioned because we have strong government expertise, but we've got commercial and private sector solutions. We are the leader with every major ecosystem partner. And you saw that -- I was talking today about the U.S. Air Force and what we are doing on the cloud modernization. And our work is mission critical. I mean, the vast majority of what we do is mission critical to the federal government. So we see a real opportunity to continue to partner with the new administration as we've partnered with all administrations, and also with all of the leaders in the federal government every day are waking up to really drive those three things. So really, really feel good about where we are positioned in the federal government to help this agenda.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Awesome, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning guys. Happy holidays. I know that last quarter, you indicated the high end of the initial revenue guide. For this fiscal year, did not require any material improvement in consulting. Just wondering if that's still the case as you're now raising the top end a little bit? Or are you now assuming any improvement in consulting since you're almost four months into the new fiscal year?\nAngie Park: Yeah, hi Jason. Good morning. And I'll take that. For us, with the raise in -- to 4% to 7% for the full year, there's really no change in what we shared with you before, which is that at the top end of the range, we continue to see more of the same, whereas at the bottom of the range, we see a bit more -- we allow for a little bit more deterioration. So no change there.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And our over delivery, I mean, we're very pleased, obviously, with consulting and managed service growth this quarter. And these large deals came in a little bit better, which is how we overdelivered and now raising the guidance.\nJason Kupferberg: Great to hear. And then I'm just looking at the net headcount adds cumulatively over the past two quarters. I think we're almost 50,000. That was a pretty big step up from what the prior trend looked like. So can you give us any sense of how much of that was from acquisitions versus organic? And I guess is there any reason to not look at this accelerated hiring as kind of a bullish indicator?\nAngie Park: So let me take that question. And as it relates to the net people adds that we had in Q1. So we did add about 24,000 people in the first quarter, which is really reflective of the momentum that we see in our business. And managing supply and demand is a core competency of ours. And what you see is the continued high utilization rates at around 90%. Looking ahead, we'll continue to hire for the demand that we see and the skills that we need. And I'll give you a little bit more context that the hiring that we saw this quarter, similar to last was that it was concentrated in India.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. And I would just say that underlying our guidance, you are seeing organic momentum, right? So at the high-end of our guidance, for the year, we are going to exit at -- the range of organic growth in our guidance is 1 to 4, right? So I think that is -- it is a positive sign that we're hiring and some of it is coming from acquisitions, but we are seeing organic momentum in our business.\nJason Kupferberg : Thanks for the comments.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys. Congrats on the solid result. And Happy holidays. Kind of asking the guidance question a little bit differently. The 4% to 7% constant currency revenue guide for the fiscal year 2025, is a touch below just the first quarter number of 8% on a constant currency basis. So just trying to think about if there is any reason why the growth would decelerate off the first quarter level as we get more into fiscal year 2025?\nAngie Park: Hi, Bryan, happy holidays to you as well. Let me give you -- here's how we were thinking about our guidance for the full year and the raise to 4% to 7%. If you think about where we are, we had a strong start in Q1. We have strong guidance in Q2, which was really driven -- it was broad-based and driven by our organic growth. At the same time, you heard Julie say, the macro remains the same. There's no change in the overall environment. And I want to reinforce importantly what I said earlier, which was we do expect -- we continue to expect inorganic contribution of about -- of a bit over 3%. And one of the things that we provided to you was how that will come in. So H1, we expect somewhere around about 4%, second half about 2%, and that will give you more of an understanding of how we see organic playing out for the year. And we will continue to see organic throughout this fiscal year. And then as it relates to -- if you think about it, we're one quarter in. We've got one quarter under our belt. We've got three more to go. And as Julie said earlier, we're executing on our strategy, and you can count on us to continue to do so.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe you guys could just talk a little bit about the industry group, the Financial Services. A lot of times, that kind of leads out of economic slowdowns. But it sounds like Banking & Capital Markets was a little bit softer, but some other areas of strength and just trying to figure out where that is in the industry right now because we're kind of getting mixed messages from some of the other IT service providers. Thanks so much.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. So -- and I think it's a little bit different by market, right? So we are seeing the results a bit different by market. I will say, by the way, that we were pleased to see the U.K., as you might have heard, is coming back as we reposition the U.K. But with the dynamics in the U.S. market where it is a little bit better, in EMEA, it was a little bit worse, and you've got a mixed picture on the interest rates, what the expectations are. And so I'd say that -- and that is probably not a surprise. Yesterday, probably complicated that a little bit in the U.S., right? And so on the one hand, we are seeing a lot of interest, for example, in Banking & Capital Markets on things like GenAI. On the other hand, there is a lot that's being kind of processed with what's going to happen with interest rates and that. And so I -- we see -- obviously, it is getting better, but it is a mixed picture by region.\nAngie Park: Yes. And just as a reminder, Bryan, as we look at Financial Services overall, we exited Q4 last year with a minus 2%, and we saw the uptick in the first quarter at 4% globally which reflects the dynamics that Julie was just describing, which really plays for our strength, as you think about the diversity of our business across markets and industries.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDarrin Peller: Guys, thanks. Great results. Could we just touch on your potential for visibility this year into budgets and the timing you'd expect again? I know last -- I think earlier this year, it was generally in the January, February time frame, which had moved back up a little bit. But do you still anticipate that kind of visibility at that part of the year? Or we could get a better picture on whether discretionary is really going to pick up or not? And then maybe just as a dovetail on that, maybe just conversations you are happening right now around AI for next year. Obviously, the bookings keep looking really strong for you guys, which is great. Any more specifics on where you are seeing it incrementally improve? Thanks guys.\nJulie Sweet: Yes. So a great understanding of Accenture. January is sort of -- January, February as we really see what the client budget is going to be looking at. So that's where we get the most visibility. And so we'll be reporting more on that in the next quarter. So you're absolutely right, we do anticipate getting that visibility in January, February. And then with respect to AI, we are continuing to see in our conversations, and I probably talked to 30 CEOs in the last 2 months, right? So spend a lot of time, and also around the world. So it's been a busy travel quarter. I've been in Europe, I've been in Southeast Asia, Australia, the U.S. So -- and pretty consistently, clients are seeking to do more in AI, but they are in such different places. I mean I'll be with one bank where we're talking about what is GenAI, AI, why does it matter? And the fact that they are not yet in the cloud. And I'll be talking to another bank where they've been fully in the cloud and they want to be the first out to use GenAI. And so I think it is hard to generalize. You are still seeing that because the overall spending environment is the same, that they're -- that those who really want to go into -- in AI are more prioritizing spending as opposed to spending more, right? Where we see the biggest opportunity when companies start to get more confident to spend more is going to be and moving faster with their data foundation that fuels AI and then AI. But right now it still generally feels more like a prioritization within current budget. And so we'll see what happens in January and February. And that's why our strategy has been to pivot there, right? So to go after [more than] (ph) our fair share of those budgets.\nDarrin Peller: All right. That's really helpful. And then just when we look at the opportunity for what you're -- where you're hiring, you mentioned India, but we've heard a lot of customers are starting to think about a little bit even more onshore. And so just maybe talk a little bit more about the mix again. It had gone for a while more offshore looking for better price optimization. But where are we on that right now? Are you seeing any evidence of a shift back to nearshore, onshore? Thanks again guys. Great job.\nJulie Sweet: No big trend. What I'd say is we focus on the G2000. So a lot of our companies are global. And so they really are looking for optimization of right skills because a big piece of why people, for example, use India is about skills, right? 10 years ago, it was about labor arbitrage, right? Today, it is about like the ability to get these skills at scale. What I would say is that we, at Accenture, are continuing to develop more because in some cases, it is language, right, as you're kind of doing more transformation, new parts of the enterprise where you want maybe lanes with skills or time zones. So we have a global network in -- with 100 centers around the world. In the U.S., for example, we've been opening some new centers in underserved environments. We just opened a center in the Bronx recently. So -- but all of it is kind of aimed at being very sophisticated, and we see ourselves as part of the integrated talent strategy of our clients. And it's like right skills, right time zone, right price, continues to be the guiding with I would say an emphasis on skills.\nDarrin Peller : Great. Thanks Julie, thanks Angie.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJim Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Julie, understand that your outlook, and you’re not really seeing any differences on macro side, and your outlook look like sort of idiosyncratic growth. But can you maybe discussed a little bit about when you talk with clients, what's the sort of range of outcomes for discretionary increases in the 2025 budget outlook? And how big a factor is rates specifically as a macro impact when they're thinking about that? And do you think that changes materially given the Fed message yesterday?\nJulie Sweet: The rates definitely depends on industry, right? So if you're a more capital-intensive industry or you're an industry that wants to grow more in acquisitions, the rates -- there's lots of puts and takes in doing the range. And I think it's just too early based on yesterday's there's been a lot of speculation. I mean our business is very much focused on like -- when there's change, and it doesn't matter what the change is, good or bad change, that's where we really partner with our clients successfully because if they've now got new constraints because the rates are higher, then they want more opportunity to cut costs. If the rate are going to fuel things like capital projects, we've got our capital projects business, right? So what we focus on, and I think what we are so successful is we have these deep relationships with our clients. Our top 100, we've been them over 10 years. We understand them. And we are always looking at this and say, okay, what that mean, anticipating what they are helping. So that's -- so whatever the change is, that's where Accenture really can help them pivot. And it's part of our strength that we're so relevant to both growth and cost.\nJim Schneider: That's helpful. Thank you. And then with respect to the AI work, you talked about some of the context of the client conversations you're having. But quantitatively, are you seeing any kind of major changes in terms of the size and scope of the individual projects? And what are clients saying about sort of their pivot or when they might pivot to sort of larger, more transformative projects within GenAI?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. We are already starting to see that, right? We are starting to see the clients -- and the characteristics are pretty clear. If you have a client that's been investing in their digital core, include security and data for many years, and we have many of those that we've helped, they're now able to start to scale, and we are starting to do that, and we're seeing those partnerships. Where you have clients where we've been helping them prove it and maybe scale in a part of the business, but they really haven't got their data foundation or they're not moving into the cloud, then what they're working with us is how do we accelerate that. And what you probably heard as we were talking through some of the examples today is that there's a lot of data foundation now being built along with getting into modern cloud platforms. And so we are seeing an acceleration of the data work, which is absolutely fundamental to using GenAI.\nJim Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yeah, hi guys. Great job. And I guess my question, just on the fiscal Q2 guide. Historically, Q2 has been a pretty flat sequential quarter. And you are guiding, I believe to down about $1 billion to $1.5 billion sequentially this quarter. I know a little of that may be a few hundred million FX, I get that. But what -- was there anything in Q1 that kind of naturally falling off in Q2 this year, that's a little unnormal or some sequential pattern that's a little different?\nAngie Park: Yes, David, happy holidays and good morning. As we think about our Q2 guide of 5% to 9%, it's a very solid guide, based upon what we see. And there's nothing unique in Q2 that I would call out. And in fact, just anchoring back to our over delivery that we saw in the first quarter was really a function of the larger deals coming online a bit better than we expected, and we continue to see that, which gave us confidence in driving -- in raising our guidance for the full year. So nothing to call out for Q2.\nDave Koning: Got you. Yes. You definitely crushed Q1. And then, I guess, one just a nerdy kind of financial question, but now that you fully have like the debt in place, should we think about a sequential pickup in interest expense? I think it was $30 million in Q1. Does that go to like $50 million in Q2 or something like that?\nAngie Park: Yes. Different than giving you the specific numbers in terms of how to think about it, yes that is correct because when you – there is certain things, of course, that we see in our income below operations. And what you saw there was the interest -- the net interest income was lower as a result of we did have average lower cash balances, also lower interest rates. And then we also had the interest expense from our long-term debt. So -- but all of that has been factored in the guidance that we've given and so it's in there.\nDave Koning: Gotcha. Thanks guys. Great job.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I want to just quickly ask a follow-up on capital structure and allocation. It sounds like you are still quite committed to pursuing both acquisitions, as well as capital return. Last year, we looked at -- we did some essentially debt raise to help fund those priorities. Where are we at from that perspective? Or do you feel like we're in a pretty good overall cash position and continue to be able to do that? Or should we expect that at some point, at least over the next couple of years, we can see further decreases in debt and debt raising to fund the capital allocation priorities?\nAngie Park: Yes. Hi James. Nice to talk to you. Why don't I start. We were pleased to execute our inaugural bond offering of $5 billion, which we did in October. And when we step back, it was really a routine review of our capital structure where we tap the long-term debt market to increase our liquidity for general corporate accounting purposes, and what it does is, it ultimately, it optimizes our capital structure and reduces our cost of capital. That said, let me just reinforce for you, there is no change to our capital allocation as strategy, which also includes how we look at and use G&A.\nJulie Sweet: And this year, we are going back to kind of more of a business as usual. We think it's going to be somewhere around $3 billion. But as we've always said, if there is opportunities or not, we've got the balance sheet. So we could raise debt, but there's no strategy to increase debt. But we might, if we had the right opportunities. I mean, last year, we had a great opportunity to double down on strategic acquisitions, and it served us well as we've gone into this year. But this year, we are back to kind of standard around $3 billion, which is kind of the right percentage. So we'll communicate as we go. We always have that flexibility. And I think that's the strength if you think about Accenture is having a strong balance sheet and to have the flexibility to go after opportunities in the market that drive long-term growth. And that's how we think about the decisions about whether or not to do debt or not.\nJames Faucette: That's great color there. And then I wanted to ask about the consulting bookings, seeing nice growth and acceleration there. I'm wondering -- and I know it is hard given the breadth of Accenture's customer base, but I'm wondering if you can help us maybe generalize what you're seeing in consulting bookings and if there's a change there? And I guess I'm wondering if we're seeing a focus on cost control versus potential revenue generation or new technology evaluation or how it folds into AI. Just any color you could provide on what the tenor of those consulting bookings look like right now?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. So maybe just keep in mind that what we're generally bringing to our clients are multiservice solution. So you might do, as we talked about, we're doing managed services in security, and that requires industry consulting as a part of it to make sure that we're doing all the work. A lot of the reinvention is a lot of process that. So I think I would anchor on -- there are really are two themes that at least -- when they come to us. They want cost efficiency. Every industry wants a cost efficiency now, and they're looking for growth or other outcomes, speed to market. You heard a lot -- when we talked about, like what we're doing with like CaixaBank, that was both speed to market, as well as efficiencies. And so that's one of the things that we focus on, and that really gives us -- it's our unique differentiation because we got things like Song, that's everything about customer, and we can put to that. We understand the industry. So the twin themes here is cost efficiency and growth.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, good morning. Many thanks and happy holidays to everyone. My first question I wanted to ask is around pricing dynamics. And you've indicated that the macro backdrop is fairly steady. You're gaining share through skills, and I wanted to ask specifically about some of the legacy areas such as application maintenance, maybe the BPO work. One of your competitors suggested that pricing is pretty challenging because there aren't enough deals and a lot of folks chasing those deals, but could you specifically address what you're seeing as pricing dynamics during the quarter? Any changes?\nJulie Sweet: It's a very competitive market, which is what we've been saying every quarter and we did see lower pricing across the business, which has been pretty consistent. What I would say is, that which makes sense, right you're in a constrained -- as we said, that the clients have constrained spending, particularly on small deals and so you'd expect it to be constrained. What I would say, though that AMS, Application Managed Services, is not legacy if you do it the way we do it, right? So what we offer to our clients is we have the talent, the full-stack engineers, the GenAI, we have a platform called GenWizard. And so clients are coming to us to say, hey, can you take off my old applications. They're coming on us to modernize while taking costs down. And you see that for -- and what the work we're doing, it's very advanced in how we are doing it. So we basically call it run to the new right? It's like have us help you run your applications in order to rotate to the new. So we see this as a critical way that we are at the heart of their business in modernizing their digital core. It's not legacy. Same thing with our operations business.\nKeith Bachman: Yes. Okay. That makes a ton of sense. Thank you Julie. My follow-up question is, some of our recent discussions, and to be fair, with software companies, have suggested that Europe's softened in the last 30, 45 days and -- which makes sense, if you just read the newspapers about what's going on in Europe. But have you guys seen any change in the dynamics underpinning Europe and/or change the perspective that you may have as it relates to European demand over the next 12 months? And that's it for me. And many thanks again, and happy holidays.\nJulie Sweet: Thanks. So our view of European demand is -- over the next 12 months, is baked into the rise of in our guidance, right? And we are all reading the same papers. Europe is definitely more, Middle East is obviously different. Europe is definitely in a more challenging environment. And you see that with our growth rate is there on a relative basis as well. But we feel very good about -- we have an excellent business in EMEA. We are very relevant to our clients. And so we feel good about the -- us -- our demand environment, and that's fully reflected in the raise in guidance that we just gave you. Thank you. Can we have the next question?\nKatie O’Conor: Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\nOperator: Absolutely. And our final question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hey, guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. I wanted to ask on the service lines here. Can you comment on performance across strategic consulting, tech services and operations?\nJulie Sweet: Yes. All very -- all strong this quarter.\nAngie Park: Yes. Bryan, the thing that I would add to that is we did see broad-based growth. And if you look at it from a consulting and a managed services type of work perspective, we had mid-single-digit growth in consulting and 11% growth in managed services. And as you think about the rate that we have for the year, which is 4% to 7% underneath that, we see consulting now in the mid-single range growth and managed services in the mid-to-high range growth.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then a follow-up here on the workforce and contract profitability. So you know the most headcount was added across India. Can you just comment on what you're seeing there as far as wage inflation dynamics, just given most services companies and GCCs have been leaning in, and particularly amid the competitive pricing environment? Just talk about the levers you have here to mitigate gross margin pressure.\nAngie Park: Yes, I'll start, Bryan. No real change in terms of the market dynamics of what we see reflected around wage inflation. And of course, we are always paying market relevant pay based upon the skills and the locations of our people. And we continue to see that the same, and then as it relates to pricing, as Julie mentioned, it is -- it continues to be highly competitive. At the same time, as you know of us, right, we are managing that. We're focused on pricing as well as on our differentiation, and we're focused on cost and delivery efficiencies in our business and how we operate.\nBryan Bergin : All right. Understood. Happy holidays.\nAngie Park : Thank you Bryan.\nJulie Sweet: Good happy holiday. Well, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support and all of our people for what you do every single day. I wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to being back here in a quarter. So thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day."}],"metadata":{"total":17,"years":{"2021":4,"2022":4,"2023":4,"2024":4,"2025":1}}}
